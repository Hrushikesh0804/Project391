HEADNOTE:
JUDGMENT:
                      J U D G M E N T
AHMADI, CJI :
1.   The short  but interesting question that arises for our
consideration is :-
     ""Whether the Awards, Bharat Ratna, Padma
     Vibhushan, Padma  Bhushan and Padma Shri
     (hereinafter   called    ""The   National
     Awards"") are ""Titles"" within the meaning
     of Article  18(1) of the Constitution of
     India?""
2.   Before dealing  with the  legal aspects of the question
at issue,  we may  briefly set out the factual matrix of the
two cases.  The two  petitions which have given rise to this
issue were  filed in  the High  Courts of  Kerala and Madhya
Pradesh (Indore  Bench),  respectively.  The  petitioner  in
T.C.(C)  No.9/94,   Balaji  Raghavan   (hereinafter   called
’Petitioner No.1’)  had  filed  O.P.No.2110/92  (hereinafter
called ’the  O.P’) on  February 13,  1992 before  the Kerala
High Court.  The petition  filed under  Article 226  of  the
Constitution, sought,  by way  of a  writ  of  mandamus,  to
prevent the  respondent from  conferring any of the National
Awards.  The  petitioner  in  T.C.(C)  No.1/95,  S.P.  Anand
(hereinafter called  ’petitioner No.2’) filed Misc. Petition
No.1900//92 (hereinafter  called ’the  M.P.’) on  August 24,
1992, before  the Indore  Bench of  the Madhya  Pradesh High
Court, praying for the same relief.
3.   In the  Kerala High  Court, the  two contesting parties
filed written submissions and counters between September 30,
1992 and  April 7,  1994. During this period, the High Court
of Kerala  did not  hear oral  arguments or pass any interim
order. However,  in the  other case, a Division Bench of the
High Court  of Madhya  Pradesh (Indore Bench), on August 25,

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 14 
1992, through  an  ex-parte  order,  issued  notice  to  the
respondent and  also restrained  it from  conferring on  any
person or  persons any of the National Awards, until further
orders. The  respondent filed  T.P.(C) Nos.6 & 7 before this
Court, seeking  to transfer  the case  and to vacate the ex-
parte order of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated August
25, 1992.  On January  8, 1993,  a Division  Bench  of  this
Court, while  refusing  to  transfer  the  case  to  itself,
directed the  Madhya Pradesh High Court to give its decision
on the  application filed by the respondent for vacating the
ex-parte order,  on or  before January  20, 1993. On January
20, 1993,  a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court
vacated its  earlier order dated August 25, 1992. Meanwhile,
the respondent  filed T.P.(C)  No.811-812/93,  by  which  it
sought transfer of both the O.P. and the M.P. to this Court.
On October 29, 1993, a Division Bench of this Court directed
that the  matter be  posted before  a bench presided over by
the Chief Justice of India on January 17, 1994. On that day,
a bench  of this  Court presided  over  by  the  then  Chief
Justice issued  notice in  T.P.  Nos.811-812/93  and  stayed
further proceedings  in both  the petitions. Later, on March
7, 1994,  this Court transferred both the aforesaid cases to
itself.
4.   Thereafter, on September 11, 1995, T.C.(C) Nos.9/94 and
1/95 were  posted before a Division Bench of this Court. The
last date for submission of written briefs by both sides was
fixed and  each side  was allotted  time for oral arguments.
While counsel  for the  petitioner No.1  and the  respondent
submitted their  written briefs  within the stipulated time,
the petitioner  No.2, however, failed to do so. The date for
the hearing  before this  Constitution Bench  was fixed  for
November 14, 1995. On October, 31, 1995, the petitioner No.2
was given  notice of  this fact. However, he did not present
himself before  the Constitution Bench and no arguments were
advanced on  his behalf.  Subsequently, after the conclusion
of the  hearing and  the judgment  being reserved,  he  sent
communications dated  November 1, 1995 and November 6, 1995,
which were  received by  the Supreme  Court on  November 15,
1995 and November 21, 1995 respectively, requesting that his
petition should  be delisted  or else  he should  be given a
hearing by  the Constitution  Bench. It  is not  possible to
accede to  his request.  A public  interest litigant  cannot
choose his  forum. Once  the case  stands transferred to the
Supreme Court,  he must make arrangements to present himself
and advance arguments before it. A Constitution Bench cannot
be expected to fix its schedule with a view to accommodating
each and  every litigant. Litigants must conform to the time
schedule fixed  by the  Court.  Hence  we  have  refused  to
entertain his request.
5.   It would now be relevant to notice the events connected
with the institution of the National Awards. It is important
to note  that a  policy of  instituting National  Awards and
Honours had  been adopted  even before  the Constitution  of
India was  formally drafted. On February 13, 1948, the Prime
Minister’s Committee  on Honours and Awards was set up under
the  Chairmanship  of  the  Constitutional  Adviser  to  the
Government of  India, Sir  B.N. Rau.  It’s  purpose  was  to
recommend the  number  and  nature  of  civil  and  military
awards; the  machinery for  making recommendations  for  the
granting of these awards; the frequency with which they were
to be awarded, etc. The Committee worked on the premise that
orders and decorations, carrying no title, were not meant to
be prohibited.  It submitted its report on March 9, 1948 and
gave  extensive  suggestions  in  respect  of  each  of  the
subjects upon  which  it  had  been  required  to  give  its

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 14 
recommendations. Thereafter,  in a  series of  meetings held
between May,  30, 1948 and October 29, 1953, the Cabinet had
occasion  to  discuss  the  nature  and  conditions  of  the
proposed National Awards.
6.   The  National   Awards  were   formally  instituted  in
January,  1954   by  two  Presidential  Notifications  No.1-
Pres./54 and  No.2-Pres./54 dated January 2, 1954 which were
subsequently superseded  by four  fresh Notifications, viz.,
No.1-Pres./55, 2-Pres./55,  3-Pres./55 and  4-Pres./55 dated
January 8,  1955. The purpose for which these awards were to
be given are as follows:-
NAME OF THE AWARD        PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS GIVEN
-----------------        -----------------------------
Bharat Ratna             For exceptional Service towards the
                         advancement  of  art, literature  &
                         science & in  recognition of public
                         service  of  the  highest order.
Padma Vibhushan          For exceptional  and  distinguished
                         service  in  any  field   including
                         service rendered by Govt. servants.
Padma Bhushan            For distinguished service of a high
                         order in any  field  including  the
                         service rendered by Govt. servants.
Padma Shri               For distinguished  service  in  any
                         field including service rendered by
                         Govt. servants.
     The  aforementioned   Presidential  Notifications  also
provide  that  any  person,  without  distinction  of  race,
occupation, position  or sex,  shall be  eligible for  these
awards  and   also  that  the  decorations  may  be  awarded
posthumously.
7.   A press  Note was  issued by the Government of India on
April 17,  1968 making  it clear  that the practice of using
Civilian Awards, such as, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and
Padma Shri,  as titles  on  letterheads,  invitation  cards,
posters,  books,   etc.,  is   against  the  scheme  of  the
Government as  the awards are not titles and their use along
with the  names of  individuals is contrary to the spirit of
the Constitution  which has  abolished titles.  It was  also
emphasised in the press note that civilian awards should not
be attached  as suffixes  or prefixes  to the  names of  the
awardees to give them the appearance of titles.
8.   In the  year 1969  and again in the year 1970, the late
Acharya J.B.  Kripalani, who  was then  a Member  of the Lok
Sabha, moved a non-official Bill entitled ’The Conferment of
Decoration on  Persons (Abolition)  Bill,  1969’  for  their
abolition. In  the draft  statement of  Objects and  Reasons
appended to the Bill, the main points were thus stated:-
a)   Although Article  18 had  abolished titles,  they  were
     sought to be brought in by the back door in the form of
     decorations.
b)   The decorations  were not  always awarded  according to
     merit, and  the Government  of the  day is not the best
     Judge of the merits or the eminence of the recipient.
c)   These ""new  titles"" were  at first  given to  very few,
     exceptional persons; this small stream had since become
     quite a flood.
     The Bill  led to  an elaborate debate in Parliament but
was ultimately defeated.
9.   On August  8, 1977,  the institution  of  the  National
Awards was  cancelled, vide  Notification No.65-Pres/77.  On
January 25,  1980 the  Government revived  these  awards  by
Notification  No.25-Pres./80  which  cancelled  the  earlier
Notification No.65-Pres./77  dated  August  8,  1997.  Since
then, the  National Awards  have been  conferred annually on

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 14 
the Republic Day.
10.  We may  now refer  to the  text of  Article 18  of  the
Constitution which reads as follows :
     ""18. Abolition of titles. -(1) No title,
     not  being   a  military   or   academic
     distinction, shall  be conferred  by the
     State.
     (2)  No citizen  of India  shall  accept
     any title from any foreign State.
     (3)  No person  who is  not a citizen of
     India shall,  while he  holds any office
     of profit  or  trust  under  the  State,
     accept  without   the  consent   of  the
     President any  title  from  any  foreign
     State.
     (4)  No person  holding  any  office  of
     profit under  the State  shall,  without
     the consent of the President, accept any
     present, emolument,  or  office  of  any
     kind from or under any foreign State.""
11.  The learned  counsel for  petitioner No.1  pointed  out
that  while   Article  18(1)  prohibits  the  conferment  of
‘titles’ by  the State  with the  exception of  military and
academic distinctions, it does not define the words ""titles""
and ""distinction"".  In an  effort to  throw light  upon this
aspect, he  referred us  to the  legislative history  of the
provision. According to him, the framers of the Constitution
had intended  to do  away with  the practice followed by the
British of  conferring various ’titles’ upon Indian citizens
who  curried   favour  with  them.  This  practice  and  the
recipients of  the titles  had earned  the contempt  of  the
people of  pre-independent India  and hence  such pernicious
practices were  proposed to  be  prohibited  in  Independent
India through  this  provision.  According  to  him,  viewed
against this  background, the  word ’title’  should be given
the widest  possible meaning  and amplitude in order to give
effect to  the legislative  intent. Since the only exception
to this  rule has been carved out in respect of military and
academic   distinctions,   it   follows   that   all   other
distinctions are impliedly prohibited. We were then referred
to several  dictionaries to  ascertain the  meaning  of  the
words   ""Title"",   ""Order"",   ""Distinction"",   ""Award""   and
""Designation"". It  was sought  to be  demonstrated that even
the dictionary meaning of the word ’title’ is wide enough to
encompass all other similar concepts.
12.  It was  further contended that the National Awards make
distinctions  according  to  rank.  They  are  divided  into
superior and  inferior classes and the holders of the Bharat
Ratna have  been assigned  the 9th  place in  the Warrant of
Precedence  (which   indicates   the   rank   of   different
dignitaries and high officials of the State). It was pointed
out that  several recipients  were following the practice of
appending these  awards to their names, using them as titles
in their letter-heads, publications and at public functions.
This practice  has continued  unabated despite the fact that
the Government  had issued  a Press Note in 1968 prohibiting
such conduct.  Says the  learned counsel,  all these factors
have resulted  in the  creation of  a rank of persons on the
basis of recognition by the State, in the same manner as was
achieved by  the conferment  of nobility  during the British
rule. This,  according  to  him,  is  clearly  violative  of
Article 14  read with the Preamble to the Constitution which
guarantee to  every citizen, equality of status. It was also
pointed out  that there  are no objective guidelines for the
manner in which the recipients are to be chosen and over the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 5 of 14 
years, these  awards have degenerated into rewards proffered
by the  powers that  be i.e.,  the Government of the day, in
great numbers, to those who serve their political ends.
13.  The learned  Attorney General  for India  prefaced  his
arguments on  behalf of  the Union  of India by stating that
almost every  country in  the world,  including  those  with
republican and socialist constitutions, follows the practice
of conferring  awards for  meritorious services  rendered by
its citizens.  The  learned  counsel  then  referred  us  to
several dictionaries  for the  meanings of ""Title"", ""Award"",
""Distinction"", ""Decoration""  and  ""Order"".  He  then  stated
that, according  to the  ordinary and  contextual meaning in
Article 18,  the word ""title"" means a title of honour, rank,
function  or   office  in   which  there  is  a  distinctive
appellation. An  appellation, according to him, is a name or
title by  which a person is called or known, something which
is  normally   prefixed  or   suffixed,  for  example,  Sir,
K.C.I.E., Maharaja,  Nawab, Dewan  Bahadur, etc. The learned
counsel submitted  that it is these appellations that appear
as prefixes  or suffixes  which are sought to be interdicted
by Article  18(1). Since  the National Awards are not titles
of nobility  and are not to be used as suffixes or prefixes,
they are  not prohibited  by Article  18. In this regard, we
were referred  to the Press Note dated April 17, 1968 issued
by the  Government of  India. The  learned  counsel  further
submitted that  the words  ""not being a military or academic
distinction"" in  Article 18  have  been  used  ex  abundanti
cautela. Since  military and academic distinctions, such as,
General, Colonel,  Professor, Mahavir  Chakra, B.A., etc. do
carry suffixes or prefixes, the framers of the Constitution,
by way  of abundant  caution, expressly  mentioned that they
would be exempted. It follows that distinctions which do not
carry suffixes  or prefixes  will not  be  affected  by  the
interdiction in  Article 18(1).  At this  stage, the learned
counsel  took   us  through   the  relevant   parts  of  the
discussions in  the Constituent  Assembly that  led  to  the
framing of Article 18(1) to support the aforesaid stance.
14.  The  learned   Attorney  General  then  reiterated  his
argument that  republican  nations  across  the  world  have
similar awards  for  recognizing  meritorious  services  and
these National  Awards are  not violative  of the  right  to
equality as  enshrined in  Part III  of the Constitution. In
this context,  we were  referred to  civil awards instituted
and conferred  by the  United Kingdom,  the United States of
America, the  Republic of  France, the  peoples Republic  of
China, the  Republic of  Canada and the former Soviet Union.
In response  to our  query for  guidelines that  control the
manner of  selection of  the recipients of these awards, the
learned Attorney  General delivered  to us  a  copy  of  the
communique that  was sent  to him  from the Ministry of Home
Affairs in this regard.
15.  Mr. Santosh  Hegde, Senior  counsel, responded  to  our
request to  act as  amicus  curiae  and  advanced  arguments
before us.  He began  by stating  that the  fact that  these
awards are  being grossly  misused had occasioned one of the
writ petitions.  He referred  us to  the  views  of  eminent
authors, Mr.  D.D. Basu and Mr. H.M. Seervai on the issue at
hand. Thereafter,  he led  us through  the relevant parts of
the  discussions   in  the   Constituent   Assembly   before
submitting that  it is  clear  that  the  Constitution  does
envisage a  situation where meritorious services rendered by
individuals are  to be  recognised by the State, through the
conferment of  awards. However,  to avoid  the criticism  of
creating a separate class, it needs to be ensured that these
awards are  not used  as prefixes  or suffixes. He concurred

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 6 of 14 
with the submission of the learned Attorney General that the
words ""military  or academic  distinction"" had  been used by
way of  abundant caution.  Commenting on the misuse of these
awards, he  submitted that the maximum number of awards that
can be  conferred should  be specified.  He also  felt  that
ordinarily, public servants and civil servants should not be
eligible for  these awards,  unless there  are extraordinary
reasons.
16.  We may  now address  the central  issue in the case. At
the outset,  we may  point out  that the marginal heading of
Article 18,  which reads  as ""Abolition  of  Titles""  is  an
incorrect summarization  of its contents as it does not seek
to abolish  titles granted  in the  past. Sir Ivor Jennings,
the noted constitutional lawyer, has described Article 18 as
""not a  right at  all, but  a restriction  on executive  and
legislative power.""
17.  From the  aforementioned discussion,  two views  on the
proper interpretation of Article 18(1) emerge:-
1)   The first,  put forth  by the  petitioners, is that the
word ’title’  in Article 18(1) is used in an expansive sense
to include  awards,  distinctions,  orders,  decorations  or
titles of  any sort whatsoever, except those that qualify as
military or academic distinctions.
2)   The second,  advanced by  the learned  Attorney General
and Mr.  Santosh  Hegde,  is  that  what  is  sought  to  be
prohibited are  titles of  nobility  and  those  that  carry
suffixes or  prefixes, which violate the concept of equality
by creating  a separate  class. According  to this view, the
words ""military  or academic  distinction"" were added by way
of abundant  caution. It  was not meant to prevent the State
from honouring  or recognizing  meritorious or  humanitarian
services rendered by citizens.
18.  We may  now refer  to the  developments  preceding  the
introduction of Article 18(1) as it presently stands and the
debates thereon amongst the framers of the Constitution. The
Constituent  Assembly,   as  we   all  know,  functioned  by
constituting Committees  which were  expected to  deliberate
and take  decisions on specific issues of Constitutional law
to be incorporated in the Constitution. On January 21, 1947,
three such  Committees were constituted by the Assembly, one
of them  being the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights,
Minorities  and  Tribals  and  Excluded  Areas  (hereinafter
called ""The  Advisory  Committee  on  Fundamental  Rights"").
Thereafter, the Assembly met at regular intervals to discuss
the reports  submitted by  the various Committees. On August
29, 1947,  the Assembly appointed a Drafting Committee which
was to analyse the reports of these Committees, take note of
the discussions  in the Assembly regarding them, and prepare
the text  of a  Draft Constitution.  This Draft Constitution
came to be prepared during February 1948 and on November 15,
1948,  the   clause-by-clause  discussion   of   the   Draft
Constitution began  in the Assembly. This process culminated
on November 26, 1949 when the Constitution as settled by the
Constituent Assembly was adopted by it.
19.  The provision  that is now Article 18 (1) was discussed
and formulated  in the  report of  the Advisory Committee on
Fundamental Rights.  This Committee had, in view of its wide
agenda, appointed  two Sub-Committees,  one  on  Fundamental
Rights and the other on Minorities. The former Sub-Committee
was chaired  by Acharya  J.B. Kripalani.  On March 25, 1947,
the present  Article 18(1)  was discussed for the first time
in the  Sub-Committee on  Fundamental Rights. The agenda for
the meeting  was the  discussion of the note prepared by Mr.
K.T. Shah on Fundamental Rights which contained five clauses
relating to  the prohibition  of, and  restrictions on,  the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 7 of 14 
conferment and  acceptance of  titles, honours, distinctions
and privileges. Clause 3 of this note read:-
     ""No artificial  or man-made  distinction
     between citizens and citizens, by way of
     titles, honours,  privileges  -  whether
     personal  or  inheritable,  -  shall  be
     recognised by and enforceable under this
     Constitution, or  laws made  thereunder:
     provided that academic degrees, official
     titles, or  popular honorifics,  whether
     of  Indian   or   foreign   origin,   or
     conferment, may  be permitted  in so far
     as they  create no  privileged class  or
     heritable distinction.""
     At the  meeting, Mr.  K.T. Shah  formally proposed  the
abolition of  titles  and  the  privileged  class  of  title
holders. In  the final  report  of  the  Sub-Committee,  the
relevant part of Clause 8 read as follows :
     ""No  titles  except  those  denoting  an
     office  or   a   profession   shall   be
     conferred by the Union.""
20.  This clause was considered by the Advisory Committee on
Fundamental  Rights   on  April   21,  1947.   A  number  of
influential  members   expressed  reservations   about   the
abolition of  titles. Mr.  C. Rajagopalachari suggested that
it should  be left  open to  the legislature  to decide from
time to time whether titles are good or bad. He stated that,
especially  if   there  was   a  nationalist,  communist  or
socialist policy,  and the  profit motive was removed, there
would be  a great necessity for creating a new motive in the
form of  titles. Sir  Alladi Krishnaswamy  Aiyar and  Mr. M.
Ruthnaswamy also  supported the omission of this clause. The
latter stated  that equality  is not  opposed to distinction
and even in a democracy, it must be provided. Mr. K.T. Shah,
however,  urged  that  the  conferring  of  titles  offended
against the  fundamental principle  of equality sought to be
enshrined in  the Constitution.  Mr.  K.M.  Panikkar,  while
suggesting a half-way solution stated:-
     ""Orders   and    decorations   are   not
     prohibited. The  heritable titles by the
     Union undoubtedly  create inequality. In
     the Soviet Union many encouragements are
     given on  account  of  certain  national
     policies. What  I am  submitting is that
     we must make a clear distinction between
     titles which  are heritable  and thereby
     create inequality  and titles  given  by
     governments for the purpose of rewarding
     merit or by recognising merit. There are
     two methods  that exist. As you know one
     is by title and the other by decoration.
     What we  have to  aim at  is really  the
     question  of  heritable  titles  and  we
     should see  that provision  is made  for
     decorations  and  various  other  things
     because it is only titles that have been
     prohibited,    not    decorations    and
     honours.""
                             (Emphasis added)
     Pressed to  a vote,  the  suggestion  that  the  clause
should be  omitted was  lost by  14 votes  to  10;  but  Mr.
Panikkar’s proposal  that only  heritable titles  should  be
forbidden was  accepted by  Mr.  Shah  and  was  unanimously
adopted by  the Committee.  The relevant part of Clause 7 of
the Committee’s  Interim Report  to the Constituent Assembly

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 8 of 14 
read :
     ""No heritable  title shall  be conferred
     by the Union.""
21.  On April  30, 1947,  this clause  was discussed  in the
Constituent  Assembly.   While  moving   the   clause,   Mr.
Vallabhbhai Patel  observed that  titles  were  often  being
abused for  corrupting the  public life  of the country and,
therefore, it  was better  that their  abolition  should  be
provided as  a fundamental  right. He  informed the Assembly
that it  had been decided to drop the word ’heritable’ as it
had  become  a  matter  of  controversy.  While  moving  the
amendment, Mr. M.R. Masani stated :
     ""This will  mean that  the  free  Indian
     State will  not confer any titles of any
     kind, whether  heritable  or  otherwise,
     that is,  for the life of the incumbent.
     It may  be possible  for  the  Union  to
     honour  some   of   its   citizens   who
     distinguish themselves  in several walks
     of life  like science and the arts, with
     other kinds  of honours not amounting to
     titles; but  the idea  of a  man putting
     something before  or after his name as a
     reward for  service rendered will not be
     possible in a free India.""
                             (Emphasis added)
     While supporting the amendment, Sri Prakasa stated:
     ""Sir, I  should like  to make  it  plain
     that this  clause does not prohibit even
     the  State   from  bestowing   a  proper
     honour. We  are  distinguishing  between
     titles and honours. A title is something
     that hangs  to one’s  name. I understand
     it is a British innovation. Other States
     also honour their citizens for good work
     but those  citizens do  not  necessarily
     hang their  titles  to  their  names  as
     people in  Britain  or  British-governed
     parts of  the world do. That is all that
     this     clause      seeks     to     do
     ........................  we   want   to
     abolish   this   corroding,   corrupting
     practice  which   makes  individuals  go
     about currying  favour with authority to
     get particular distinctions.""
                             (Emphasis added)
     While opposing  the amendment,  Seth Govind Das and Mr.
H.V. Kamath  complained that  the clause  covered  only  the
future conferment  of titles  and that it was necessary also
to  abolish   titles  conferred   earlier  by   the   ""alien
imperialist Government"".  Mr. Vallabhbhai  Patel in replying
to the  debate referred  to the  point raised by Seth Govind
Das and  Mr. Kamath. Pleading for forgetting ""all about past
titles"", he  said that  the Assembly  was really legislating
for the  future and  not for  the past;  some people who had
obtained titles  from the  British Government after they had
""spent so  much"" and  ""worked so  hard"" for  them, should be
left alone; disturbing their titles might be ""interpreted as
a sign of spiteful feeling"".
     After the acceptance of the amendment moved by Mr. M.R.
Masani the relevant part of the clause read as follows :
     ""No title shall be conferred by the Union.""
22.  With a  minor modification,  the provision  appeared as
Article 12(1)  in the  Draft Constitution  prepared  by  the
Drafting Committee:-

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 9 of 14 
     ""Article 12(1)  - No  title shall  be conferred  by the
State.""
23.  The Drafting Committee and its Special Committee, after
considering the various comments, suggestions and amendments
received on  draft article 12, suggested further amendments.
The Constitutional  Advisor, Sir  B.N. Rau,  supported these
new amendments and stated:
     ""Presumably  it  is  not  intended  that
     titles   such    as   ""Field   Marshal"",
     ""Admiral"",   ""Air    Marshal"",    ""Chief
     Justice""  or   ""Doctor""  indicating   an
     office   or    profession,   should   be
     discontinued. It may be pointed out that
     the term  ""State""  as  defined  includes
     ""all local  or other  authorities within
     the   territory    of    India"".    Nor,
     presumably, is  it intended  to prohibit
     the award  of medals  or decorations for
     gallantry, humanitarian  work, etc.  not
     carrying any title.""
     The Drafting Committee redrafted Article 12(1) to read:
     ""Hereditary titles  or other  privileges
     of birth  shall not  be conferred by the
     State.""
24.  It is  important to  note that  when, on  November  30,
1948, draft  article 12  came up for final discussion before
the Constituent  Assembly, Dr.  Ambedkar did  not  move  the
amendment for  redrafting clause  (1) of  Draft  Article  12
which had earlier been accepted by the Drafting Committee.
     The Draft  article, as  presented to the Assembly, read
as it was framed originally by the Drafting Committee :-
""1) No title shall be conferred by the State.""
     Mr. T.T.  Krishnamachari sought  to add  the words ""not
being a  military or  academic distinction""  after the  word
title in  clause (1).  He  felt  that  this  was  necessary,
firstly,  because   certain  types   of  titles  had  to  be
permitted,  the  Government  having,  for  example,  already
decided to  confer certain  military distinctions; secondly,
because the  State might  decide to  revive academic  titles
like Mahamahopadhyaya,  and  lastly,  because  a  university
might not be completely divorced from a State in view of the
definition of  the latter in draft article 7. (Article 12 of
the Constitution).
25.  The  amendment  moved  by  Mr.T.T.  Krishnamachari  was
accepted by the Constituent Assembly on December 1, 1948 and
the final clause [later renumbered by the Drafting Committee
as Article 18(1)] read as it does today.
     Note: The  quotations  that  appear  in  the  preceding
paragraphs have  been extracted  from Volumes III and VII of
the Constituent  Assembly Debates  and from  ""The Framing of
India’s Constitution"", a study in five volumes, edited by B.
Shiva Rao.
26.  We may  also refer  to the  views expressed by Sir B.N.
Rau. As already stated, he was appointed the Chairman of the
Prime Minister’s  Committee on  Awards and Honours which was
appointed as  early as in 1948. At the very first meeting of
the Committee,  one of  the members  raised the issue of the
validity of  the proposed  awards, in  view of Article 12 of
the Draft  Constitution which  sought to abolish titles. Sir
B.N. Rau, who had, in his capacity as Member of the Drafting
Committee contributed  to  the  discussion  regarding  Draft
Article 12,  pointed out  that ’titles’  did not necessarily
include all orders and distinctions. He referred to the U.S.
Constitution which  forbids the  grant of titles of nobility
but allows  decorations such  as the  Congressional Medal of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 10 of 14 
Honour and  the Distinguished  Service Cross. He stated that
in Constitutions  where orders  and decorations  as well  as
titles are  intended to  be prohibited,  separate mention is
usually made, as had been done in Article 73 and Article 109
of the Danzig and Weimar Constitutions respectively.
27.  We may  now refer  to the  constitutional provisions of
certain other  countries analogous  to Article  18(1) of our
Constitution:
1.   Article 73  of the Danzig Constitution (as it then was)
read :
""Titles- with  the exception of academic degrees:- shall not
be  awarded   except  when   they  denote  an  office  or  a
profession.
Orders and Decorations may not be awarded by the free State.
No national of Danzig may accept titles or orders.:""
     2.The Constitution  of The United States
     of America, 1787.
     Article 1,  Section 9  Clause (8)  : ""No
     title of  nobility shall  be granted  by
     the United States; and no person holding
     any office of profit or trust under them
     shall, without  consent of the Congress,
     accept any  present, emolument,  office,
     or title  of any  kind whatever from any
     King, Prince, or foreign State.""
     3.The Constitution of Japan.
     Article XIV  : ""Peers  and Peerage shall
     not be  recognised. No  privilege  shall
     accompany   any    award   of    honour,
     decoration or any distinction, nor shall
     any such  award be valid beyond the life
     time of  the  individual  who  holds  or
     hereafter may receive it.""
     4.The Constitution  of the  Republic  of
     Ireland, 1937
     Section 40  (2) : ""1. Titles of nobility
     shall not be conferred by the State.
     2. No title of nobility or of honour may
     be accepted  by any  citizen except with
     the prior approval of the Government.""
     Similar provisions are to be found in :
     (i) Article  3, Section  1,  Sub-section
     (9) of  the Constitution of Philippines,
     1935;
     (ii) Article  78 of  the Constitution of
     Iceland, 1944;
     and
     (iii)  Article   109   of   the   Weimar
     Constitution, 1919.
28.  From the  discussion in the preceding paragraphs, it is
clear that  in enacting  Article 18(1),  the framers  of the
Constitution sought  to put  an end to the practice followed
by the  British in  respect of  conferment of  titles. They,
therefore, prohibited  titles  of  nobility  and  all  other
titles that carry suffixes or prefixes as they result in the
creation of  a distinct  unequal class of citizens. However,
the framers  did  not  intend  that  the  State  should  not
officially recognise  merit  or  work  of  an  extraordinary
nature. They,  however, mandated  that the honours conferred
by the  State should  not be  used as  suffixes or prefixes,
i.e., as titles, by the recipients.
29.  Awards of  this nature  are conferred by many countries
around the  world. Even  countries such as the United States
of  America,   whose  Constitutions   specifically  bar  the
conferment of  titles of  nobility, follow  the practice  of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 11 of 14 
regularly conferring civil awards. In the United States, the
Presidential Medal  of Freedom,  instituted in 1957, honours
Americans and  others who  make exceptional contributions to
national security  or interest,  world peace, culture and so
forth. In  France, the  Palmes Academiques  is  awarded  for
merit in  teaching and  for literature,  science  and  other
cultural activities.  There are also other awards for social
merit, public  health, tourism, craftsmanship, postal merit,
etc. The Canadian Government established the Order of Canada
in 1967  and it  is awarded  for a  wide variety  of  fields
including agriculture,  ballet, medicine, philanthropy, etc.
The Order  of  Canada  has  three  levels  of  membership  -
Companion, Officer  and Member.  The total  number of living
companions may  not at  any time exceed 150. No more than 15
Companions, 46  Officers and  92 Members may be appointed in
any given  year. The  Order of Merit which is said to be the
inspiration behind  the National  Awards, was  instituted in
1902, and  is awarded  for outstanding  service  by  British
Scientists, writers, or other distinguished civilians. It is
limited to 24 members. It does not carry any title or rank.
30.  The National Awards are not violative of the principles
of  equality   as  guaranteed   by  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution. The  theory of  equality does not mandate that
merit  should   not  be   recognized.  Article  51A  of  the
Constitution speaks  of  the  fundamental  duties  of  every
citizen of  India. In  this context,  we may  refer  to  the
various clauses  of Article  51A and specifically clause (j)
which exhorts every citizen ""to strive towards excellence in
all spheres  of individual  and collective activity, so that
the nation  constantly rises  to higher  levels of endeavour
and achievement.""  It is,  therefore, necessary  that  there
should be  a system  of awards  and decorations to recognise
excellence in the performance of these duties.
31.  Hereditary  titles   of  nobility   conflict  with  the
principle of  equality insofar  as they  create a  separate,
identifiable class  of people who are distinct from the rest
of society  and have  access to  special privileges.  Titles
that are  not hereditary but carry suffixes or prefixes have
the same  effect, though  the degree  may be  lesser.  While
other Constitutions  also prohibit  the conferment of titles
of nobility,  ours may  perhaps be  unique in requiring that
awards conferred by the State are not to be used as suffixes
or prefixes.  This difference  is borne  out of the peculiar
problems that  these titles  had created  in pre-independent
India and  the earnest  desire of the framers to prevent the
repetition  of  these  circumstances  in  Free,  Independent
India.
32.  It has  been contended  before us  that over the years,
the purpose  for which these awards were instituted has been
diluted and  they are  granted liberally  to persons who are
undeserving of  them. The  perversion of  the system was the
motivating factor  behind the  Bill introduced in Parliament
by Acharya  Kripalani to abolish these decorations. It is to
be remembered that Acharya Kripalani was the Chairman of the
Sub-Committee  on   Fundamental  Rights  where  the  present
Article 18(1)  was originally formulated. He was, therefore,
fully aware  of the  exact import  of Article  18(1). It  is
significant that in the debates in Parliament, the thrust of
his attack  was on the misuse of these decorations. However,
it is axiomatic that the misuse of a concept does not change
its inherent  nature. The  National Awards  do not amount to
""titles"" within the meaning of Article 18(1) and they should
not be  used as  suffixes or  prefixes. If this is done, the
defaulter should forfeit the National Award conferred on him
or her by following the procedure laid down in Regulation 10

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 12 of 14 
of each  of the  four notifications  creating these National
Awards.
33.  The guidelines  contained in  the communique  from  the
Ministry of  Home Affairs  towards the selection of probable
recipients are  extremely wide, imprecise, amenable to abuse
and wholly  unsatisfactory for  the important objective that
they seek  to achieve.  There are  no limitations prescribed
for the  maximum number  of awards  that can be granted in a
given year or the maximum number that is permissible in each
category.  The   Prime  Minister’s  Committee  on  Awards  &
Honours, 1948  had recommended  certain limitations in terms
of numbers  but these  have not  been  incorporated  in  the
extant guidelines.  As stated  earlier, most  countries have
provided for  such limitations  in respect  of  their  civil
awards. That  is for  the obvious reason that the importance
of the  awards is  not diluted.  While in  the grant  of the
Bharat Ratna  award sufficient restraint has been shown, the
same cannot  be said  of all  other awards.  The exercise of
such restraint  is absolutely  necessary  to  safeguard  the
importance  of   the  awards.  That  is  why  the  need  for
necessarily  granting   awards  every   year  also  requires
reconsideration. These  and the  fixing of  other  criteria,
which will  ensure that  the recipients  of these awards are
subjected to feelings of respect rather than suspicion, need
to be  examined by  a  high  level  Committee  that  may  be
appointed by  the Prime  Minister in  consultation with  the
President of  India. Even  otherwise it  is time that such a
committee looks  into the working of the existing guidelines
in view  of the experience gained. We say no more as we have
entrusted the  task of  setting up  of the Committee to high
level functionaries.  We may only say that the Committee may
keep in  view our  anxiety that  the number of Awards should
not be  so large  as to dilute their value. We may point out
that in  some countries,  including U.S.A., the total number
of Awards to be given is restricted. With these observations
we dispose of both the petitions - cases with no order as to
costs.
34.  Before we  part with  the case, we would like to record
our appreciation  for the  assistance provided to us, at our
request, by Mr. Santosh Hegde, Senior Counsel.

Kuldip Singh, J.
     I have read the opinion proposed by A.M. Ahmadi, CJI. I
agree with  the Chief  Justice that  Bharat Ratna  and Padma
awards  are   not  ""titles""   within  Article   18  of   the
Constitution of  India. These  awards can  be given  to  the
citizens for exceptional and distinguished services rendered
in art,  literature, science  and other fields. These awards
are national  in character  and only those who have achieved
distinction at  national level  can be  considered for these
awards. The  question to  be considered, however, is whether
the purpose  of instituting  these awards  is being achieved
and these  are being conferred on the deserving persons. The
history and  experience shows  that, in the beginning, these
awards were  given to a limited number of persons but in the
recent years  there have  been floodgates  of awards for the
person who  are well  known, lesser  known and even unknown.
The Padma  awards have  been conferred  on  businessmen  and
industrialists who have multiplied their own wealth and have
hardly helped  the growth of national interest. Persons with
little  or   no  contribution  in  any  field  can  be  seen

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

masquerading as  Padma awardees.  The existing procedure for
selection of candidates is wholly vague and is open to abuse
at the  whims and  fancies  of  the  persons  in  authority.
Conferment of  Padma awards  without any firm guidelines and
fool-proof method  of selection  is bound to breed nepotism,
favoritism, patronage and even corruption.
     During the  British occupation India has had a spate of
title hunters  who brought  degradation  and  much  harm  to
healthy public  life. The  title hunters  have  always  been
considered a  menace to the safe growth of a society. Though
the Padma awards are not titles but in case these awards are
given at  the whims of the authorities - without there being
proper criteria  and method of selection - they are bound to
do more  harm to  the society  than  the  title-seekers  did
during the British regime.
     While opposing  the  Bill  titled  ""The  Conferment  of
Decorations on  Persons (Abolition)  Bill,  1969""  moved  by
Acharya J.B.  Kripalani in  the Parliament, Mr. N.K.P. Salve
in his  speech (Parliamentary  Debates, November  27,  1970)
stated as under:-
     ""SHRI N.K.P. SALVE : I am aware that the
     decorations    have     been    bestowed
     indiscriminately  on   businessmen   and
     others. In  fact, one  of my suggestions
     is that  any decoration  awarded to  any
     person  who   is  found  guilty  of  any
     ’commercial    offence’     should    be
     withdrawn.  We   should  be   extremely,
     strict    about    the    awarding    of
     decorations............   SHRI    N.K.P.
     SALVE :  I am entirely in agreement with
     Shri Madhu Limaye that some of them have
     received   these   decorations   without
     deserving them  in the  least if  at all
     they deserved anything, it was something
     else.    But    they    have    received
     decorations. In  fact, it  is within  my
     knowledge that  some of  them  have  put
     their    decorations    to    commercial
     exploitation.   In   fact,   a   certain
     managing director  of a  company wrote a
     letter  to   me  sometime  ago.  On  his
     letterhead was  written ’Ex-Rai Bahadur,
     Padma    Vibhushan’     so    and     so
     ................
     The   criteria    for   awarding   these
     decorations  are  not  very  clear.  The
     Bharat  Ratna   is  to  be  awarded  for
     exceptional    service    towards    the
     advancement  of   art,  literature   and
     science, whereas  the Padma Vibhushan is
     to  be   awarded  for   exceptional  and
     distinguished service.  Bharat Ratna  is
     for  exceptional   service   and   Padma
     Vibhushan   is   for   exceptional   and
     distinguished service.  Exceptional  and
     distinguished service  must be given the
     number one  decoration  and  not  number
     two. So,  there is  a patent  fallacy in
     this type  of criteria  which  has  been
     laid down.  It seems some bureaucrat has
     written this  without understanding  all
     these anomalies in the matter. I do hope
     that   they    do   some    amount    of
     rationalisation of this matter.""

     The above  words were  spoken in  the Parliament  about
quarter of  a century back. There has been no application of
mind at  all by the successive Governments and the system of
giving Padma  awards is getting degenerated with the passage
of time.  It has  already reached a point where political or
narrow group interests are being rewarded by those in office
for the time being.
     The  examination  of  initial  deliberations  regarding
institution of  these awards  show that in the first meeting
of the  committee  held  on  February  27,  1948  under  the
Chairmanship of  Mr. B.N.  Rau, it  was recommended  that an
extremely high  standard  should  be  prescribed  for  these
awards and  total number  of  award  to  be  given  in  each
category should  be limited  and fixed.  It was  recommended
that awards  should be  made  very  sparingly  and  only  on
grounds of outstanding merit. They should not be made merely
because  there  happen  to  be  vacancies  in  a  particular
category. The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India,
prepared a note dated January 10, 1953 for the consideration
of the Cabinet. It was proposed to institute suitable awards
for meritorious  public services. The note clearly suggested
that the  number of  recipients in  various awards  must  be
restricted.  The   report  was  considered  by  the  Cabinet
presided over by Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and was accepted with
some minor modifications.
     Therefore,  to  ensure  that  Padma  awards  are  truly
national  in   character  and   above  party  and  political
considerations, I suggest that a committee at national level
be  constituted   by  the   Prime  Minister   of  India   in
consultation with  the President of India which may include,
among others, the Speaker of Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice of
India or his nominee and the leader of Opposition in the Lok
Sabha. At  the State  level similar committees may be formed
by the  Chief Minister of the State in consultation with the
Governor. The  committee may,  among others, include Speaker
of the  Legislative Assembly,  Chief Justice of the State or
his nominee and the leader of the Opposition.
     The function  of the  State committees  may only  be to
recommend the names of the persons, who in their opinion are
deserving of  a particular  award. The  final decision shall
have to  be taken  by the  National Committee  on Awards. No
award should  be conferred  except on  the recommendation of
the National  Committee. The  recommendation must  have  the
approval of the Prime Minister and the President of India.
     The number  of  awards  under  each  category  must  be
curtailed to  preserve their  prestige and  dignity. In  any
given year  the awards,  all put  together, may  not  exceed
fifty.
     The writ petitions are disposed of. No costs."

HEADNOTE:
JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     We have  perused the  order of  the  High  Court  dated
November 24,  1975. The  only question raised relates to the
validity of  the Ordinance  which has already been upheld by
the Full  Bench of  that Court.  It was  argued relating  to
legislative competency.  Since it  is a  matter relating  to
land reform  and land, it is covered by Schedule 7, List II,
item Nos.14  and 18. As a result, the impugned Act is within
the legislative  competence of  the State legislature. It is
then contended  that it  is violative  of Art.14. We find no
force in  the contention. Since the legislature is competent
to enact  the law,  all the  agricultural  holdings  covered
under the  Act are  equally regulated thereunder. Therefore,
there is  no discrimination  violating Art.14.  It  is  next
urged that  the procedure  prescribed is in violation of the
Code of  Civil Procedure, a Central Act. We find no force in
the  contention.  The  procedure  is  only  supplemental  or
residual to  the main  purpose of  the Act.  CPC is  in  the
Concurrent List.  The Act  received assent of the President.
The  legislature,   therefore,  is   competent  to   provide
procedure in  the implementation  of the  provisions of  the
Act. Next  submission is  that the  trial provided under the
Act is  unjust, unreasonable  and unfair.  We find  that the
summary procedure  having been prescribed for early disposal
of  these   cases,  causes   minimum  inconvenience  to  the
litigants,  which   is  just  and  fair  procedure.  It  is,
therefore, reasonable  and fair  to the  parties.  Elaborate
procedure like  trial need not necessarily be provided as is
in vogue  in civil  suits. The  time consuming  process  was
sought to  be curtailed  and fair procedure was streamlined.
As one  of its  facets it  is argued  that the Letter Patent
Appeal was  taken away under the Act and that, therefore, it
offends the  right to  fair hearing  and the CPC. We find no
force in  the contention.  Creation of  the hierarchy of the
court is  one of  legislative policy. With a view to curtail
multiplicity of  appeals, the  legislature  stepped  in  and

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
saved structural appeals. The legislature limited the remedy
by providing  for only one appeal to the High Court before a
learned single  Judge against  the orders  of the  Board  of
Revenue or  consolidation authority etc. Since that question
was  fully  canvassed  before  the  Full  Bench,  which  has
considered the same in extension and upheld the abolition of
the special  appeal, we  are in agreement with the reasoning
and conclusion of the Full Bench.
     We do  not find any justification for interference. The

                          JUDGMENT
J.S. VERMA, J. :
     This is  an appeal  by  the  returned  candidate  under
Section 116A  of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951
(for short  ""the  R.P.  Act"")  against  the  judgment  dated
5th/6th August,  1991 in Election Petition No. 21 of 1990 by
S.N. Variava,  J. of  the  Bombay  High  Court  whereby  the
election of  the appellant  to the  Maharashtra  Legislative
Assembly from  49-Kurla  Legislative  Constituency  held  on
27.2.1990 has  been declared  to be void on the ground under
Section 100(1)(b)  for commission of corrupt practices under
sub-section (3)  and (3A)  of the  R.P.  Act.  By  the  said
judgment,  the   learned  Judge  has  decided  the  election
petition and  made the  order under Section 98 declaring the
election of  the appellant  to be  void but  the findings on
issue Nos.  2 and  5 have  been reserved  for being recorded
after the  inquiry under  Section 99  of  the  R.P.  Act  is
concluded  against  Chhagan  Bhujbal,  Pramod  Mahajan,  Bal
Thackeray, Manohar Joshi and Pramod Navalkar to whom notices

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 14 
have been  issued under  Section 99  of the  R.P. Act by the
order made  therein. The  ultimate conclusion  in the  final
order made  in  the  impugned  judgment  is  quite  involved
because of the unusual mode adopted of deciding the election
petition piecemeal.  Instead of  attempting to summarise the
conclusion, it  is safer  to quote  certain portions  of the
concluding part of the judgment, as under :-
     ""I"" have  already held that the cassette
     was displayed  in the  Constituency with
     the consent  of the Respondent. There is
     however no  proof that it was personally
     exhibited by the Respondent. Accordingly
     it will have to be held that, by mode of
     display of  this  video  cassette,  some
     other persons  with the  consent of  the
     Respondent have  committed  the  corrupt
     practice of  appealing for  votes on the
     ground of the Respondent’s religion i.e.
     Hindu religion  and  have  attempted  to
     create   enmity   and   hatred   between
     different  communities   and   religions
     particularly Hindu  and Muslims. On this
     count  itself,   the  election   of  the
     Respondent   must    be    set    aside.
     Accordingly, Issues  Nos. 3  and 6  have
     been answered  in  the  Affirmative  and
     Issue Nos. 1 and 4 have been answered in
     the Negatives.
          However, before  the final order is
     passed the  last and  the main  mode  of
     canvassing i.e. by means of the speeches
     made by  Mr. Bal Thackeray and the other
     leaders of  the  Shiv  Sena  and  B.J.P.
     alliance at  the meetings  held on  29th
     January, 1990  and 24th  February, 1990,
     has to  be considered.  I have  read the
     speeches  of   Mr.  Bal  Thackeray,  Mr.
     Pramod Mahajan, Mr. Chaggan Bhujbal, Mr.
     Manohar     Mahajan,      Mr.     Pramod
     Navalkar........  On  reading  of  these
     speeches,  I   am  of   the  prima-facie
     opinion that  all the abovenamed persons
     have by  their  speeches  committed  the
     corrupt practice  of having appealed for
     votes on  the ground  of the Respondents
     community  and   religion   i.e.   Hindu
     community and  religion. They have also,
     prima-facie  at   least,  committed  the
     corrupt practice of attempting to create
     enmity  and   hatred  between  different
     classes of  citizens  on  the  basis  of
     religion  and   community,  particularly
     between  Hindus   and  Muslims.  I  have
     already set out above that in cases like
     the   present   the   consent   of   the
     Respondent can  be and  is  implied.  As
     stated above  the effect  and import  of
     the entire  speech has to be considered.
     At  this   prima-facie   stage   it   is
     therefore not  possible to pin point any
     particular portion or portions. That can
     only by  done after  hearing the  import
     and effect  and  interpretation  of  the
     speeches from  the person  who made  the
     speeches. Thus before I express my final

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 14 
     opinion I  intend to issue notices under
     Section  99  of  the  Representation  of
     People Act,  1951 to all the above named
     persons. thus the answer to Issues 2 and
     5 has been reserved till after the final
     disposal   of    the   Notices    issued
     hereunder.
          Accordingly, I direct that separate
     Notices  under   Section   99   of   the
     Representation of  People Act,  1951  be
     issued to Mr. Bal Thackeray, Mr. Manohar
     Joshi, Mr.  Chaggan Bhujbal,  Mr. Pramod
     Navalkar and  Mr. Pramod Mahajan........
     To each  Notice shall  also be annexed a
     copy of this Judgment. In each Notice it
     will be  pointed that in the Judgment it
     is  already   held  that  the  concerned
     speech/speeches were  with  the  implied
     consent of the Respondent.""
     xxx              xxx                 xxx
          ""As it  has been  held that corrupt
     practice has  been committed  by mode of
     wall  paintings  and  display  of  video
     cassettes, the petition is made absolute
     in terms of prayers (a) and (b) i.e. the
     Election  of   the  Respondent   to  the
     Maharashtra     Legislative     Assembly
     election held on 27th February, 190 from
     Constituency   No.    49   i.e.    Kurla
     Constituency is  declared  as  null  and
     void. This is on the ground that corrupt
     practice  set   out  above   under  sub-
     sections (3)  and (3A) of Section 123 of
     the Representation  of Peoples Act, 1951
     have been  proved to have been committed
     with the  consent of the Respondent i.e.
     that there  has been  an appeal  to vote
     for the  Respondent in  the name  of his
     religion  i.e.  Hindu  religion  and  an
     attempt  has   been  made   to   promote
     feelings classes of citizens of India on
     the ground of religion and community.""
                          (emphasis supplied)
     After the  impugned  judgement  was  rendered,  notices
under Section  99  of  the  R.P.  Act  were  issued  to  the
aforesaid five  persons who  then raised certain preliminary
objections to  the validity  of the  notices. Variava, J. by
his order  dated 6.1.1992  rejected  those  objections.  The
notices given  to these  persons related to certain speeches
alleged to have been made by them on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990
which, it  was alleged,  constituted corrupt practices under
Sections 123(3)  and 123(3A)  of the  R.P. Act.  In the said
order dated  6.1.1992, Variava,  J.  has  mentioned  certain
facts in  the background  of which  the  objections  to  the
notices under  Section 99  were considered  in  that  order.
Those facts mentioned at the outset in the said order are as
under :-
          ""Petition No.  21 of 1990 is not an
     individual Election Petition before this
     Court. In  respect of the same elections
     i.e. the  elections to  the  Maharashtra
     Legislative Assembly  held  in  February
     1990, ten such petitions have been filed
     before this  Court.  All  of  these  are
     against various successful candidates of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 14 
     Shiv Sena  and Bharatiya  Janata  Party.
     All these petitions are based on a plank
     of  Hindutva/Hinduism  alleged  to  have
     been  adopted   by  these   parties  and
     allegedly declared  by their  leaders at
     the joint  Public meetings held by these
     two parties  on 29th  January  1990  and
     24th  February   1990.  In   all   these
     petitions  the   charges  are  that  the
     respective respondents,  their  election
     agents and/or  some other  persons  have
     with  the   consent  of  the  respective
     Respondents, committed corrupt practices
     of appealing for votes on the grounds of
     the candidates  religion, community  and
     casts viz. Hindu religion, community and
     caste  and   the  corrupt   practice  of
     creating  enmity   and  hatred   between
     various  classes   of  citizens  on  the
     ground of  religion, community and caste
     particularly between Hindus and Muslims.
     Thus the  charges are under Secs. 123(3)
     and 123(3A)  of  the  Representation  of
     Peoples Act, 1951. The mode of resorting
     to these  corrupt practices have been by
     way of  speeches made  by the leaders of
     the two  parties at  the joint  meetings
     held on  29th  January,  1990  and  24th
     February,  1990,  by  use  of  offending
     poster, banners,  wall  writings  and  a
     video cassette  ""Awahan and Avhan"". This
     is  the   same  material  in  all  these
     Petitions. Then in individual Petitions,
     there are  allegations of  speeches made
     in the individual constituencies, either
     by the respective Respondent of somebody
     else with his consent.
          In this  Petition also, the charges
     against the  Respondent and  the alleged
     mode of  canvassing are  the same.  Thus
     the charge  is that  the Respondent, his
     election  agents   and/or   some   other
     persons have with his consent, committed
     the corrupt  practices of  appealing for
     votes on  the grounds of the Respondents
     religion, community and caste viz. Hindu
     religion, community  and caste  and  the
     corrupt practice  of creating enmity and
     hatred  between   various   classes   of
     citizens  on  the  ground  of  religion,
     community and caste particularly between
     Hindus and Muslims. Thus the charges are
     under Secs.  123 (3) and 123 (3A) of the
     Representation of  Peoples Act, 1951. In
     this Petition  also the  alleged mode of
     resorting to  these corrupt practices is
     by way  of speeches  made by the leaders
     of Shiv  Sena and  B.J.P. at  the  joint
     public meetings  held  on  29th  January
     1990 (at  Shivaji Park)  and by  use  of
     offending   posters,    banners,    wall
     writings and  the video cassette ‘Awahan
     and avhan’.""

     At the beginning of the impugned judgment, the scope of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN

the election  petition and  the true perspective in which it
has to be decided has been stated by Variava, J. as under :-
          ""It must  also be  noted that these
     group of petitions are to a large extent
     unlike other  election  petitions.  This
     because these  petitions are  not  based
     upon  individual  acts  of  individuals.
     They   are   mainly   based   upon   the
     abovementioned   plank   and/or   policy
     decision of  these  parties.  This  will
     have  a   bearing  on  the  question  of
     consent. It  is therefore  necessary  to
     note the make up of the Shiv Sena party.
     This already forms part of two Judgments
     of this court.""
     xxx               xxx                xxx
          "".........  Unlike  other  Election
     Petitions the  main charge  is not of an
     individual corrupt  practice committed b
     an   individual    candidate   in    his
     constituency.   really   speaking,   the
     charge  against  the  candidate  is  the
     charge  of  implementing  the  plank  as
     decided by the party........ In my view,
     in cases  like this, where the plank has
     been declared by the leader of the party
     and the leader of the party has complete
     control of  the affairs  of  the  party,
     once it  is proved  and held,  that  the
     plank declared  by the leader amounts to
     a corrupt  practice, every  candidate of
     that  party   will  be   bound  by  that
     plank...... As  is  set  out  hereafter,
     prima-facie  it  does  appear  that  the
     plank of  Hindutva/Hinduism, as declared
     by the  leaders at  these  two  meetings
     amounts  to   the  corrupt  practice  of
     appealing for  votes in  the name of the
     Hindu  candidates   religion  and   also
     amounts  to   the  corrupt  practice  of
     attempting to  create enmity  and hatred
     between different classes of citizens on
     the grounds  of community  and religion,
     particularly    between    Hindus    and
     Muslims.......""
     It is this perception of Variava, J. which has coloured
his entire  judgment and led to the decision of the election
petition, not  confined  to  the  record  of  the  case  but
extending to all the general impressions.
     An objection  expressly taken  to the  validity of  the
notices that  they could  not be  issued after  the election
petition had  been decided  by making an order under Section
98 of the R.P. Act was rejected by order dated 6.1.1992. The
connected Civil  Appeal No.  93 of  1992 by Chhagan Bhujbal,
Civil Appeal  No. 94  of 1992  by Pramod  Mahajan and  Civil
Appeal No.  2396 of 1992 by Balasaheb Thackeray, are against
the order dated 6.1.1992 passed by Variava, J. rejecting the
objections of these notices to the validity of notice issued
under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The inquiry required to be
made under  Section 99 of the R.P. Act has not yet been made
in the  High Court against any of the notices in view of the
pendency of  these appeals.  It may  be mentioned  that  two
remaining notices  Pramod Navalkar  and  Manohar  Joshi  had
filed Civil  Appeal No. 149 of 1992 and Civil Appeal No. 795
of 1992 against rejection of their objections to the notices

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 6 of 14 
but those appeals have been summarily dismissed on 19.8.1993
and  7.9.1993   apparently  leaving  open  the  question  of
validity of  the notices  to be  decided at  a later  stage.
There is no dispute at the hearing of these appeals that the
case of  all the  five notices  has to  be dealt with in the
same manner depending on the final outcome of these appeals.
     We would  now  consider  the  points  which  arise  for
decision.
Dismissal of  Election Petition under Section 86 of the R.P.
Act, 1951.
     The first  submission in  these  appeals  is  that  the
election petition  was liable  to be dismissed under Section
86 of  the R.P. Act for non-compliance of sub section (1) of
Section 81,  inasmuch as  the election  petition  was  filed
after expiry  of the  prescribed period  of 45 days from the
date of  election. Acceptance  of  the  nominations  of  the
candidates was  on 8.2.1990,  the date of poll was 27.2.1990
and the result of election was declared on 1.3.1990 at which
Ramakant Mayekar was declared elected. The election petition
was filed  on 16.4.1990. Admittedly the last date for filing
the election  petition according to the prescribed period of
45 days  was 14.4.1990,  but the  High Court  and its office
were closed  for holidays  on 14th  and 15th April, 1990 and
reopened only  on 16.4.1990.  If Section  10 of  the General
Clauses Act  applies, then  the election  petition filed  on
16.4.1990 was  within time.  We have  already  held  in  the
connected Civil  Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs.
Nitin Bhaurao  Patil & Anr. - decided today, that Section 10
of the  General Clauses Act applies to an election petition.
It must,  therefore, be held that this election petition was
filed within  time. This argument on behalf of the appellant
is, therefore, rejected.
Meaning and  Effect of  Sections 98  and 99 of the R.P. Act,
1951.
     The next  question for consideration is the legality of
deciding the election petition and declaring the election of
the returned  candidate to  be void by making an order under
Section 98  of the  R.P. Act,  and then  proceeding to issue
notice under Section 99 to the aforesaid five persons on the
basis of  speeches alleged  to have  been made  by  them  on
29.1.1990 and  24.2.1990 which  form the basis of the ground
under Section  100(1)(b) for  declaring the  election to  be
void. The  question really  is: Whether notice under Section
99 of the R.P. Act can be issued for commission of a corrupt
practice,  after  making  an  order  deciding  the  election
petition  and   declaring  the   election  of  the  returned
candidate to  be void?  This specific objection taken by the
notices has  been rejected  by Variava,  J. The  legality of
this view arises for consideration.
     As for  the speeches  alleged  to  have  been  made  on
29.1.1990, it  may be stated at the outset that they have to
be excluded  from consideration  since they  cannot form the
basis of  any corrupt  practice at the election, inasmuch as
they relate  to a period prior to the date on which Ramakant
Mayekar became  a candidate  at the  election as  defined in
Section 79(b)  of the R.P. Act. This is the settled position
in law.  [See Subhash  Desai vs.  Sharad J.  Rao and Others,
1994 Supp.  (2) SCC 446; Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Raj Narain,
1975 Supp. SCC 1; Mohan Rawale vs. Damodar Tatyaba, 1994 (2)
SCC 392]. This was the undisputed position at the hearing of
these appeals before us since the speeches mad eon 29.1.1990
were prior  to the  date on  which Ramakant Mayekar became a
candidate at  the election.  It follows necessarily that the
impugned judgment  as well  as the subsequent notices issued
under Section  99 of  the R.P. Act, are unsustainable to the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 7 of 14 
extent they  are based  on the speeches alleged to have been
made on  29.1.1990. No  further discussion  is necessary for
holding that  part of  the impugned  judgment dated  5th/6th
August, 1991,  notices under  Section 99 of the R.P. Act and
the subsequent  order dated 6th January, 1992 as contrary to
law and,  therefore, liable  to be set aside for this reason
alone.
     It is  only the surviving part of the impugned judgment
and the  notices which  require further  consideration,  for
which purpose  the question for decision at the threshold is
the validity  of the course adopted of deciding the election
petition  and   declaring  the   election  of  the  returned
candidate to be void and then proceeding to give notices for
taking action under Section 99 of the R.P. Act.
     We  have  already  indicated  the  combined  effect  of
Sections 98  and 99  of the  R.P. Act in the connected Civil
Appeal No.  4973 of  1993 -  Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao
Patil & Anr. - decided today. The correct legal position has
been overlooked by the High Court.
     The High  Court appears to have misread the decision of
this Court in D.P. Mishra vs. Kamal Narayan Sharma and Anr.,
1971 (1)  SCR 8, to form the opinion that the course adopted
by it  was permissible under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The
question in  that case  was of  the failure  to issue notice
under Section 99 of the R.P. Act to a person alleged to have
committed  the  corrupt  practice  for  which  the  returned
candidate also  was guilty.  The High  Court, in the appeal,
did not  comply with  the  requirement  of  Section  99  for
avoiding further  delay. This  Court rejected  that view  as
incorrect and held as under :
          ""We are  unable to  agree with  the
     view so  propounded by  the High  Court.
     Under s.  99 of the Act the Court has no
     discretion in  the matter,  if the Court
     was of  the view  that any person who is
     proved at  the trial to have been guilty
     of any  corrupt practice,  not  to  name
     that person. It is true that preliminary
     objections were  argued  at  an  earlier
     stage, but  Sharma could  not before the
     appeal was  heard ask the Court to issue
     a notice  under s.  99 of the Act on the
     footing that his case which was rejected
     by the  Tribunal will  be accepted.  The
     duty under  the Act  is  cast  upon  the
     Court or the Tribunal, and on the ground
     that the  party has  not applied  for  a
     notice, the  High Court  could not avoid
     the obligation  imposed  by  statute  to
     take proceeding  under s. 99 against the
     person proved  at the trial to have been
     guilty of  corrupt practice  and to name
     him. We  fail  also  to  appreciate  the
     ground  on  which  the  High  Court  has
     referred to  delay being an ""outweighing
     factor"". Shyamacharan Shukla was however
     not a party to the proceeding and before
     he could  be named  a notice  must go to
     him under s. 99 of the Act.
          We direct  that the  proceeding  be
     remanded to  the High Court and the High
     Court do  give  notice  to  Shyamacharan
     Shukla under s. 99 of the Representation
     of the  People Act,  1951, to appear and
     to show cause why he should not be named

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 8 of 14 
     for  committing  corrupt  practices.  If
     Shyamacharan Shukla appears in pursuance
     of the  show cause  notice  he  will  be
     entitled to  an  opportunity  of  cross-
     examining  witnesses  who  have  already
     been examined  by the  Tribunal and  has
     given evidence  against him  and he will
     be entitled  to  give  evidence  in  his
     defence and of being heard.....
                             (at pages 29-30)
     There is  nothing in  this decision to support the view
taken by  the High  Court that  it could decide the election
petition and  make an  order under  Section 98 declaring the
election of  the returned  candidate to  be  void  and  then
proceed under  Section 99  of the R.P. Act against the other
persons.
     It is,  therefore, clear  that  the  impugned  judgment
dated  5th/6th   August,  1991   declaring  the  appellant’s
election to  be void and the subsequent order dated 6.1.1992
rejecting the  preliminary objections  to the  notice issued
subsequently under  Section 99,  both by  Variava,  J.,  are
contrary to  law and  have to  be set  aside. We have not to
determine the nature of the final order to be made.
Speeches
     We have  already indicated that the speeches alleged to
have been  made on  29.1.1990 are  irrelevant and have to be
excluded from consideration as earlier stated. In respect of
the speeches  alleged to  have been  made on  24.2.1990, the
relevant portions of the impugned judgment are as under :
          ""The question  then is  whether the
     Respondent  was   also  present  at  the
     meeting held on 24th February 1990. Here
     again the  petitioner has  admitted that
     her  only   source  of   knowledge   are
     newspaper reports. In this case however,
     not a  single newspaper  report  support
     the case  that all  34  candidates  were
     present  or   that  the  Respondent  was
     present....... Thus the only evidence of
     Respondent’s presence at this meeting is
     this photo.  The court has looked at the
     photo and  the Respondent  a  number  of
     times.   It    is   not    possible   to
     categorically state  that  this  is  the
     photo of  the Respondent. If that be so,
     then the  benefit of doubt must be given
     to the  Respondent. Thus,  there  is  no
     evidence before  this court to show that
     the  Respondent   was  present   at  the
     meeting held  on 24th  February 1990. If
     that  be   so,  then   the  question  of
     considering the  Respondent’s case,  why
     he was  not present at this meeting does
     not  arise   at  all.  It  was  for  the
     petitioner to satisfy the court that the
     Respondent was  present at this meeting.
     The petitioner  has failed  to do  that.
     Therefore, so far as the meeting of 24th
     February, 1990  is concerned,  it is not
     possible to hold that the Respondent was
     present at that meeting.""
                          (emphasis supplied)
The above finding relating to speeches by some persons other
than the appellant can have relevance only if the element of
appellant’s  consent   is  also   pleaded  and  proved.  The

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 9 of 14 
appellant’s  consent   was  attempted  to  be  made  out  by
implication only from the fact of his personal presence when
those speeches  were made.  However,  the  above  conclusion
reached  by  the  High  Court  shows  that  the  appellant’s
presence at  the meeting  was not  found to  be proved. This
being so,  the element  of candidate’s  consent which  is  a
constituent part  of the  corrupt practice  alleged  on  the
basis of  speeches made  on 24.2.1990  by some other persons
has not  been found proved. That finding alone is sufficient
to reject the allegation of corrupt practice on the basis of
speeches made  by others  on 24.2.1990,  as not proved. When
this is  the conclusion  reached in respect of the appellant
himself with  regard to  the allegation  of corrupt practice
based on  speeches made  by others  on 24.2.1990,  then  the
question of  recording a  finding that  the corrupt practice
has been  proved, does not arise and, therefore, the further
question of  naming any  other person  who could  have  been
proved at  the trial  to be  guilty of  the corrupt practice
under Section 99 of the R.P. Act does not arise.
     The pleading  in respect of speeches made in the public
meeting held at Shivaji Park, Dadar on 24.2.1990 is in paras
22, 23  and generally  in para  27 of the election petition.
These are  the only  portions of  the election  petition  on
which  reliance   is  placed  by  learned  counsel  for  the
respondent as  the pleading  on this point. It is pleaded in
para 22  that the  speeches were  made by  Bal Thackeray and
other leaders  of the  alliance in  that meeting  where  the
present appellant  (respondent in the election petition) and
all other  candidates of  Shiv  Sena  -  BJP  alliance  were
present. Thereafter,  in paras  23 and  27, there  is only a
general averment  that the  appeal made by Bal Thackeray and
other leaders  to the  voters was  with the  consent of  the
appellant (respondent  in the  election petition).  No  fact
other  than   the  averment  of  personal  presence  of  the
appellant was  pleaded  to  make  out  the  consent  of  the
appellant required for constituting the corrupt practice. As
earlier indicated, the High Court has held that the presence
of the  appellant at that meeting has not been proved. Thus,
the only  basis for  pleading and  attempting to  prove  the
appellant’s consent  to the  making of those speeches in the
meeting held  on 24.2.1990  has been  held to be not proved.
There is  thus no foundation even for a tentative finding of
any corrupt  practice on  the basis  of speeches  alleged to
have been  made by  Bal Thackeray  and some other leaders in
this case  against the  present  appellant,  inasmuch  as  a
necessary ingredient  of the corrupt practice, i.e., consent
of the  appellant has  been found  to be  not proved.  There
being not  even a tentative basis to hold the charge of this
corrupt practice  proved against  the appellant, the further
question of invoking Section 99 to name any other person for
the commission  of that  corrupt  practice  along  with  the
returned candidate does not arise.
     In short,  the finding  of corrupt practice against the
appellant on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made
by  some   leaders  in   the  meeting   of  24.2.1990  being
unsustainable, this  charge has  to  fail  and  no  occasion
arises in  the present  case for  taking  any  action  under
Section 99  of the  R.P. Act.  This  part  of  the  impugned
judgment as  well as the remaining part of the notices under
Section 99 of the R.P. Act also have to be set aside.
     The only surviving question now is whether the impugned
judgment, to the extent it survives against the appellant on
the basis  of wall  paintings and  video  cassettes  can  be
sustained.
Wall Paintings

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 10 of 14 
     After the  above conclusion  reached in  respect of the
speeches alleged  to have  been  made  by  some  leaders  on
29.1.1990 and  24.2.1990 for  the reasons already given, the
only remaining  findings of corrupt practice recorded by the
High Court  are based  on certain  wall paintings  and video
cassette which  have been  found to  constitute the  corrupt
practices under  Section 123(3) and 123(3A) of the R.P. Act.
We would now examine these findings on merits.
     The pleading  relating to  the  allegation  of  corrupt
practice based  on wall paintings is contained in para 21 of
the election petition which is as under :
          ""The  petitioner  states  that  the
     respondent  and   his  agents  with  the
     consent of the respondent have also used
     posters,  banners   and  wall  paintings
     canvassing to  vote for  the respondent,
     appealing the  voters to  vote  for  the
     respondent  in   the   name   of   Hindu
     religion. The  petitioner  has  got  the
     photographs   taken    of   such    wall
     paintings. The  petitioner craves  leave
     to refer  to  and  rely  upon  the  said
     photographs as and when produced.""
                          (emphasis supplied)
     Except  for   repeating  the   words  of   the  statute
prescribing the  corrupt practice,  there is  no pleading of
the  material   facts  or   any  particulars   necessary  to
constitute the corrupt practice as required by Section 83(1)
of the R.P. Act. Reference is made to certain photographs of
the alleged  wall paintings  and it  has been  said that the
photographs would  be relied  on as  and when  produced. The
contents or  form of the wall paintings or their photographs
has not been pleaded and the photographs referred in para 21
of  the  election  petition  were  neither  annexed  to  the
election petition nor copy thereof furnished to the returned
candidate along  with a copy of the petition. Thus, there is
no pleading  in the  election petition  of the  language  or
contents  of  the  wall  paintings  which  were  alleged  to
constitute the  corrupt practice  of canvassing for votes in
the name of Hindu religion.
     If the  mere mention  of photographs without indicating
its contents  in the election petition is to be construed as
incorporation of  its contents  by reference in the election
petition, then  non-supply of  the copy  of the  photographs
with the  copy of the election petition would result in non-
compliance of  Section 81(3). However, since the photographs
were not  annexed to the election petition, it is a case not
of non-compliance  of Section  81(3) but  a  case  of  total
absence of  any pleading  in the  election petition  of  the
corrupt practice  on the basis of wall paintings. Therefore,
the  pleading  being  wholly  deficient  in  material  facts
necessary  to   constitute  the  cause  of  action,  it  was
insufficient to  raise a  triable issue  on that  basis.  In
fact, this  part of the pleading was liable to be struck out
since it  was irrelevant at the trial for the reason stated.
It is  clear that any evidence adduced later, in the absence
of the  requisite pleading  of  this  corrupt  practice  was
irrelevant  and   inadmissible  and  should  not  have  been
recorded and  having been  recorded must  be  excluded  from
consideration. The  finding of the High Court of any corrupt
practice being  proved on this basis is contrary to law, and
has to be set aside for this reason alone.
     In view of the above conclusion in relation to the wall
paintings, any further discussion of the finding recorded by
Variava, J.  on this  question would  be unnecessary but for

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 11 of 14 
the serious  grievance made  to the mode of the trial. Since
the finding  reflects the common perception which influenced
the trial  and decision of the several election petitions in
the High  Court as  mentioned in  the impugned  judgment, it
becomes necessary  to refer  to the discussion on this point
in the impugned judgment.
     As indicated  earlier, no  triable issue  arose in  the
absence of proper pleadings relating to the corrupt practice
alleged on  the ground  of  wall  paintings,  much  less  an
occasion for  a finding adverse to the returned candidate on
this point.  Surprisingly,  evidence  was  recorded  of  the
alleged  contents   of  the   said  wall  paintings  through
production of  certain photographs  later at  the  trial.  A
description of what is seen in these photographs is given in
the impugned  judgment to  indicate  that  they  showed  the
saffron flag and election symbol of the Shiv Sena and sought
votes for the Shiv Sena candidates. The judgment then refers
to the  English translation  of the  slogans  therein  which
reads, as under :
          ""......   In order  to  remove  the
     brokers  of  corruption,  let  us  throw
     around the  Gulal of Hindutva""..... ""the
     lady sits  angrily in  Delhi Court, save
     Maharashtra by electing Sena-BJP"".......
     ""Our determination is firm. Stamp on the
     Bow and Arrow"" and ""Keep Hindutva awake,
     elect the  bow and  arrow."".......  ""for
     the protection  of  fiery  Hindutva  the
     Shiv Sena BJP candidate......""
     The judgement  then proceeds  to hold as
     under :
     ""......   There can be no doubt that the
     ""Hindutva"" in  these  wall-paintings  is
     the same  ""Hindutva""  contained  in  the
     video cassettes ""Awahan and Avhan"". They
     are therefore an appeal to vote for Shiv
     Sena BJP  candidates viz. The Respondent
     for protection of that ""Hindutva"". As is
     set out  hereafter an appeal in the name
     of ""Hindutva""  amounts to  an appeal  to
     vote for  the Hindu  candidates of  Shiv
     Sena BJP on the ground of their religion
     and also amounts to the corrupt practice
     or creating  enmity and  hatred  amongst
     different classes  of  citizens  on  the
     grounds of religion and community. These
     paintings   on   walls   and   pipelines
     therefore amount  to having  appealed to
     the voters to vote for the Respondent on
     the ground  of  his  religion  and  also
     amount  to   the  corrupt   practice  of
     creating  enmity   and  hatred   amongst
     different classes  of  citizens  on  the
     grounds of religion and community.""
Thereafter, the  discussion relates  to the  consent of  the
candidate which  is  unnecessary  in  view  of  the  earlier
conclusion.
     The tenor  of the  impugned judgment,  particularly the
above extract,  leaves no  doubt that  the High Court was of
the view  that any  appeal for  votes wherein  was  made  of
""Hindutva"" is  by itself  sufficient to  amount to an appeal
for votes  for the  Hindu candidates of Shiv Sena-BJP on the
ground of  their religion  and  is  a  corrupt  practice  or
creates enmity  and  hatred  amongst  different  classes  of
citizens on the grounds of religion and community. The above

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 12 of 14 
extract from  the decision  itself is sufficient to indicate
the erroneous  perception in  this behalf  which is  clearly
contrary to law. The distinction between sub-section (3) and
(3A)  of   Section  123  which  are  two  different  corrupt
practices, was  totally  lost  sight  of,  and  obliterated.
Moreover, the use of the word ""Hindutva"" in the abstract was
understood by  the High  Court to  amount to  an appeal  for
votes on  the ground  of Hindu  religion  if  the  candidate
happened to  be a  Hindu to  constitute the corrupt practice
under sub-section  (3); and  at the  same  time  this  alone
without anything  more has  been held to also constitute the
corrupt practice  under sub-section  (3A)  of  Section  123,
totally obliterating  the distinction between these two sub-
sections of  Section 123  constituting two different corrupt
practices. Unfortunately, this erroneous construction of the
statute leading  to the formation of a wrong perception, led
the High  Court to commit the several errors commencing with
the treating  of deficient  pleadings to  be  sufficient  to
raise  a   triable  issue   of  a   corrupt  practice.  This
extraordinary  procedure,   impermissible  in  law,  led  to
reception  of   considerable  irrelevant   and  inadmissible
evidence for  which no  basis can  be found  in the election
petition.
     In short,  the trial  of the election petition became a
roving inquiry  into the  affairs of  a political party when
the only  concern at the trial should have been the merit of
the charge  of corrupt  practices attributed to the returned
candidate  at  the  election.  Actions  of  the  party  were
relevant only  to  the  extent  relatable  to  the  returned
candidate, in  the manner  pleaded in the election petition.
Unfortunately, this  crucial factor  was overlooked  by  the
High Court in the trial of the election petition.
     In the  abstract, the meaning of the word ""Hindutva"" is
not confined  only to  Hindu religion  unrelated  to  Indian
culture and heritage and it is the context and the manner of
its use  which determines  its true  meaning in a particular
speech. The  kind of  use made  of the  word ""Hindutva"", the
context and  the composition  of the  audience to  which the
speech is  addressed, are  all significant. In the connected
Civil Appeal  No. 2453  of 1991  - Shri  Suryakant Venkatrao
Mahadik vs.  Smt. Saroj  Sandesh Naik  (Bhosale)  -  decided
today, we  have indicated how the use of the word ""Hindutva""
in the context and in the circumstances in which it was used
in that  case amounted  to an appeal for votes on the ground
of Hindu religion for a Hindu candidate. As a proposition of
law, it cannot be said that in the abstract, the mere use of
the  word   ""Hindutva""  during  an  election  campaign  must
necessarily mean  an appeal  on the ground of Hindu religion
for a  Hindu candidate.  We have  discussed this question at
some length in the connected Civil Appeal No. 2835 of 1989 -
Bal Thackeray  vs. Prabhakar K. Kunte and Ors. - (with Civil
Appeal No. 2836 of 1989) decided today. It is unnecessary to
reiterate the same herein.
     What is  forbidden by  law is  an appeal by a candidate
for votes  on the ground of ‘his’ religion or promotion etc.
of hatred  or enmity  between groups  of people, and not the
mere mention of religion. There can be no doubt that mention
made of  any religion  in the  context of  secularism or for
criticising the  anti-secular stance  of any political party
or candidate  cannot amount to a corrupt practice under sub-
section (3)  or (3A)  of Section 123. In other words it is a
question of  fact in  each case and not a proposition of law
as understood and enunciated by the High Court.
     The view  taken by  the  High  Court  in  the  impugned
judgment indicates  a  wrong  perception  based  on  a  mis-

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 13 of 14 
construction of  sub-sections (3)  and (3A)  of Section 123,
obliterating at  the same  time the  distinction in  the two
corrupt practices  defined  in  these  two  provisions.  The
finding of  the High  Court of proof of the corrupt practice
based on wall paintings in also, therefore, set aside.
Video Cassette
     The only  surviving question now relates to the corrupt
practice alleged  on the  basis of  certain video cassettes.
The pleading  is in paras 15 to 18 of the election petition.
There is  a general averment that the alliance had taken out
video cassettes for the purpose of its election campaign and
that  they   were  exhibited   at  various   places  in  the
constituency. It  is alleged  that the contents of the video
cassettes amounted  to appeal for votes in the name of Hindu
religion and they tended to create enmity and hatred amongst
the voters  on the  basis of  caste, creed and religion. The
only specific  fact pleaded apart from the general averment,
contained in para 18 is as under :-
          ""..... Bal  Thackeray also  boasted
     that if any one is obstructing the Hindu
     religion, he  will fix  him.  That  they
     (Shiv Sena)  will stop  all offering  of
     ""Namaz"" on  roads  and  bring  down  the
     loudspeakers  from   the  mosques.   Bal
     Thackeray has  gone  to  the  extent  of
     coaxing the  voters to scream aloud that
     they will  not tolerate  any one  coming
     into  power  with  the  help  of  Muslim
     votes.""
It is significant that here also the pleadings are deficient
and the  only averment  which may  be treated as specific is
the  above   extract  attributing   certain  speech  to  Bal
Thackeray of  which  also  no  particulars  are  given.  The
requisite pleading  of the  candidate’s consent for this act
of Bal  Thackeray to  constitute a  corrupt practice  by the
candidate (appellant)  is not pleaded apart from the general
pleading of consent elsewhere.
     This state  of pleading  relating  even  to  the  video
cassettes, when  the video  cassettes or its transcript were
not produced  along with  the election  petition or its copy
furnished with  the copy  of the  election petition  to  the
appellant, is  a serious  defect in  the pleading which once
again has  been totally  overlooked at  the  trial  of  this
election petition.  This again  has resulted  in raising  an
issue for  which the  requisite pleadings were not there and
then admitting considerable evidence which is irrelevant and
inadmissible. We  have considered this question at length in
the connected  Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi
vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today. For the same
reasons, the  entire issue  relating to the corrupt practice
based on  the  video  cassettes  has  to  be  excluded  from
consideration.
     Even otherwise  the only specific pleading on the point
which is  extracted above  is  insufficient  to  plead  this
corrupt   practice    against   the   appellant,   howsoever
reprehensible it  may be  in relation to the alleged conduct
of Bal  Thackeray. The  more fact  that  Bal  Thackeray  was
leader of  Shiv Sena  of which  party the  appellant  was  a
candidate is  by itself not sufficient to hold any candidate
guilty of  the corrupt  practice on the basis of an act done
by Bal  Thackeray unless  that liability  can be fastened on
the candidate  on further  proof that  the act was done with
the consent of the candidate or the display of that cassette
was made  with the candidate’s consent at the specified time
and place  etc. during  his  election  campaign.  All  these

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 14 of 14 
material facts  were required to be pleaded and proved, but,
instead, they  have been assumed and even the finding is not
related to any such specific act.
     The  requisite  consent  of  the  candidate  cannot  be
assumed merely  from the  fact that the candidate belongs to
the same  political party  of which  the wrong  doer  was  a
leader since  there can  be no presumption in law that there
is consent  of every  candidate of  the political  party for
every act  done by  every acknowledged leader of that party.
The corrupt  practice for  which a  candidate  can  be  held
vicariously guilty for an act of any other person who is not
his agent  in whose  favour general  authority is  presumed,
must be  pleaded and  proved to  be with  the consent of the
candidate.  Obviously,   it  is   so   because   the   penal
consequences  resulting   from  the  finding  of  a  corrupt
practice against  the candidate are visited on the candidate
including the  setting aside of his election. The High Court
assumed for the purpose of pleading as well as proof that no
specific pleading  or proof  of consent of the candidate was
necessary if  the act was attributed to any leader or even a
member of  the same political party. The distinction between
the ground  in  Section  100(1)(b)  on  which  the  election
petition was  allowed and  that under  Section 100(1)(d)(ii)
was completely  missed. Admittedly, the ground under Section
100(1)(d)(ii) is  neither the basis of the election petition
nor is it of the judgment of the High Court.
     It is  this erroneous  assumption made of the law as an
abstract proposition,  which has  resulted  in  the  several
serious errors  in the  trial as  well as  in  the  impugned
judgment. This  discussion is  sufficient to  set aside  the
only remaining finding against the appellant.
     From the above discussion, it follows that the findings
on  all   points  against  the  appellant,  of  the  corrupt
practices held  to be  proved against the appellant, have to
be set  aside, and  so  also  the  impugned  judgment  dated
5th/6th August, 1991, resulting in dismissal of the election
petition. The notices issued by the High Court under Section
99 of the R.P. Act to Chhagan Bhujbal, Bal Thackeray, Pramod
Mahajan, Manohar  Joshi and Pramod Navalkar after conclusion
of the trial must also be quashed for the above reasons.
     The result of this decision is that the inquiry against
Pramod Navalkar  and Manohar Joshi pending in the High Court
in this matter also terminates.
     The appeals are allowed. The appellant Ramakant Mayekar
would get  costs throughout  from the respondent Smt. Celine
D’Silva (election  petitioner). The  other parties will bear
their own costs throughout."

     Bahadurgarh was  declared as  an urban  estate  by  the
State Government  of Haryana in exercise of powers conferred
by section  3 of  the Punjab  Urban Estates  (Development  &
Regulation) Act,  1964 (hereinafter  ’the Punjab  Act’). The
declaration of  any area  to be  ’urban estate’, permits the
State  Government,   inter  alia,   to  sell  the  sites  in
accordance with  the Punjab  Urban Estates  (Sales of Sites)
Rules, 1965  (for short  ’the Punjab  Rules’). An  offer was
accordingly made  for free  hold sale of about 2200 plots on
first come  first serve  basis in Sector No.6 of the estate.
Applicants were  informed that  ""all modern  amenities  like
underground  sewerage,   storm   water,   drainage,   roads,
electricity, supply of potable water etc. will be provided"".
Pursuant to  this invitation,  a number  of persons  some of
whom are  the members  of appellant-Association, applied for
allotment. Appellant  No.2, Jeet  Ram, is one such applicant
and by  memo of  even  number  dated  9.8.1972,  the  Estate
Officer, Faridabad  informed Jeet Ram about the allotment of
residential Plot  No.852 to  him  on  terms  and  conditions
mentioned in  the memo.  (Similiar is the position qua other
allottees). We  are concerned  with condition  Nos.4  and  5
which read as below :
     ""4.  In case, you accept this allotment,
     you should  send the enclosed acceptance
     in the  form given at Annexure A to this
     letter together  with a  Bank draft  for
     Rs.750/- in order to make 29 per cent of

     In case  of failure  to deposit the said
     amount  within   the  above   sepecified
     period, the allotment shall be cancelled
     and the  deposit of  10 per cent Earnest

     5.   The  balance   of   80   per   cent
     tentative  price  can  be  paid  lumpsum
     without interest  within  60  days  from
     date of  issue of  this allotment letter
     or in  the  annual  equated  instalments
     with 7 per cent interest as laid down in
     Rule No.12  framed under  section  23(2)
     (b) (3)  (3) of the Punjab Urban Estates
     (Development and  Regulation) Act, 1964.
     The  first  instalment  shall  fall  due
     after the  expiry of  one year  from the
     date of issue of this allotment order"".
2.   As per  condition No.5  aforesaid, the first instalment
became due  on 9.8.1973,  that is,  after expiry of one year
from the  date of  issue of  the  allotment  order.  On  the
instalment not having been paid, respondent No.2, the Estate
Officer, sent  notices to  the  members  of  the  appellant-
Association to  pay the instalments including 7% interest on
the total  price of  the plot. Failing which, it was stated,
that action  under section  10 of  the Punjab  Act would  be
taken  which   visualises  resumption  and  forfeiture.  The
members of  the Association acted as required by the notices
but without  actually taking possession of the plots. It was
so because the plots had not been developed as visualised by
the    advertisement     seeking    applications.    Various
representations were  made  to  respondent  No.2  for  early
development and  for delivering the possession of the plots.
It was  also represented that the members of the Association
were being  charged  interest  without  actual  delivery  of
possession of  the plots  which according to the members was
not permissible.
3.   Despite the  aforesaid representations,  as  the  plots
were not developed, appellant No.2 approached the High Court
of Punjab  & Haryana  by  invoking  its  jurisdiction  under
Article 226  of the Constitution. The High Court has held in
the impugned  order that interest was chargeable. As regards
possession, the following observation was made in para 4 :
     ""4.  As regards  possession, it  may  be
     noticed   that    the   stand   of   the
     respondents  was   that  development  is
     still taking  place and  as soon  as the
     development is  completed, possession of
     the plot  would be offered to petitioner
     No.1. It  was further  stated at the bar
     that   in   case   the   petitioner   is
     interested in  taking possession  of the
     undeveloped  plot,  they  are  prepared.
     Counsel  for   the  petitioner  was  not
     prepared to accept this offer.""
Feeling aggrieved  at the  view taken by the High Court this
appeal has been preferred under Article 136.
4.   Shri  Bhandare,   learned  senior   counsel   for   the
appellants, has  strenuously contended that what was offered
for allotment  was developed plots and not undeveloped ones.
The follow  up submission is that as the plots are yet to be
developed fully,  the respondents  could  not  have  charged
interest because  possession of developed plots is yet to be

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

given. The  stand of  the respondents  on the  other hand is
that charging  of interest is not co-related to the delivery
of possession,  as  is  in  case  of  allotments  under  the
provisions of  Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977
in view  of what  has been  mentioned in  Rule 5(7)  of  the
Haryana Urban  Development Authority  (Disposal of  Land and
Buildings)   Regulations,    1978,   (brevi   mani   Haryana
Regulations) provision  in which would not apply to the case
at hand in as much as the same is not the requirement of the
Punjab Rules.  Ms. Nisha,  appearing  for  the  respondents,
submitted that  as per  Rule  12(2)  of  the  Punjab  Rules,
interest accrues from the date of the issue of the allotment
order as has been mentioned in the aforesaid condition No.5.
5.   The allotment  in the  present  case  being  under  the
Punjab Rules,  we are  satisfied that  the provisions of the
Haryana Regulations  cannot be  called  in  aid  and  it  is
because of  this that  terms and conditions mentioned in the
allotment order  of other  persons, an  instance of which is
the allotment  to  one  Surat  Singh  by  memo  No.23  dated
28.2.1979, can  be of  no assistance to the appellants. Shri
Bhandare’s alternative  submission is  that in  any case  as
possession of  developed  plots  has  yet  not  been  given,
interest  cannot   be  demanded,  even  as  per  the  scheme
visualised by the Punjab Rules. A perusal of the Rules shows
that after  applications are made for allotment and the same
are accepted,  possession of  the site  is  required  to  be
delivered to  the transferee,  as mentioned in Rule 7, after
he has paid 25% of the price. Another provision of the Rules
which is  required to  be noted  is that  the transferee  is
required to  complete the  building within  three years from
the date  of issue of allotment order as per Rule 14, though
this time limit may be extended by the Estate Officer, if he
is satisfied  that the  failure  to  complete  the  building
within the  period of  three years  was due to causes beyond
the control of the transferee.
6.   We are  thus satisfied  that if the Rules are read as a
whole, possession  of the  allotted plot  is required  to be
given within  reasonable time  after payment  of 25%  of the
price. Rule  14 itself would indicate that possession has to
be delivered  soon after  the allotment  order to enable the
transferee to  complete the building within three years from
the date  of issue of allotment order. The submission of Ms.
Nisha is  that Rule  14 having  visualised extension  of the
time  limit,   this  Rule  would  not  require  delivery  of
possession soon  after the  payment of the 25% of the price.
According to  us, this submission cannot be accepted because
the power of extension given to the Estate Officer is really
meant to  be exercised when the transferee, after receipt of
possession of the land, is not in a position to complete the
building.  We,  therefore,  hold  that  interest  cannot  be
demanded till  offer of  possession is  made.  There  is  no
dispute that appellant No.2 had paid the required amount. It
is also  not in  dispute that the possession of the plot was
not delivered within reasonable time thereafter.
7.   Shri Bhandare  has taken  pains to  persuade us to hold
that it  is incumbent  on the  part of the Estate Officer to
deliver possession  of developed  plots and  as even by 1985
such plots  had not  been offered  for  delivery,  as  would
appear from  the  order  passed  by  this  Court  itself  on
14.1.1985,  there  can  be  no  justification  in  demanding
payment of  interest.  As  per  the  learned  counsel,  full
development  is  yet  to  take  place  in  as  much  as  the
statements made  by the respondents in their application for
vacation of stay, which was registered as I.A. No.2 of 1992,
were as below :

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 5 
     ""1. that  the Sector-6,  Bahadurgarh  is
     almost fully developed.
     2) That  150 houses  are constructed for
     which the  completion certificates  have
     been issued.
     3) That  near about 250 houses are under
     construction.
     4) That water supply work is completed.
     5) That road works in the sector is also
     completed.
     6)  That   the  internal  sewerage  line
     S.W.D. (Storm  Water drainage) have been
     laid down  and  temporary  disposal  has
     been completed.""
     Ms. Nisha,  however, states  that this  position was in
1992; by  now, she  has instruction  to stay that plots have
been fully developed.
8.   To decide  the aforesaid submission of Shri Bhandare we
would really be required to find out as to whether the offer
was of  developed plots  or undeveloped  plots. As the offer
had stated  that  modern  amenities  noted  above  ""will  be
provided"", it  cannot be  held that  till the  amenities  as
mentioned  have   become  fully  functional,  the  offer  is
incomplete. It  is for  this reason  that the fact that full
development has  not yet  taken place,  even if  that be the
position as  contended by  Shri Bhandare, cannot be a ground
to hold  that interest  has not  become payable.  It is true
that the  applicants  were  given  to  understand  that  the
amenities noted  above would  become available  (and  within
reasonable time),  the fact  that the  same did  not  become
available to the desired extent could not be a ground not to
accept delivery  of possession.  From the  order of the High
Court which  we have quoted above, we find that the offer of
possession of  the undeveloped  plot was not accepted by the
counsel of  the appellant. That order being of 17th October,
1980, we  are of  the view  that interest did become payable
from that  date. The  fact that  plot has not yet been fully
developed, as  is the case of the appellant, has, therefore,
no significance  in  so  far  as  charging  of  interest  is
concerned. We are not in a position to accept the submission
of Shri  Bhandare that  equity would  not demand charging of
interest,  even  though  the  plots  are  yet  to  be  fully
developed. When  parties enter  into contract,  they are  to
abide by  the terms  and conditions  of the same, unless the
same be inequitable. In the present case, question of equity
does not  really arise  in as much as the condition relating
to interest  is founded  on a statutory rule, vires of which
has not  been challenged.  The provision  in a  cognate rule
cannot alter  the consequence  which has  to follow from the
rule which holds the field. In the present case it being the
Punjab Rules  under which the allotment was made, we are not
in a  position to  agree with  Shri  Bhandare,  despite  his
forceful submission, that the appellants may not be asked to
pay interest, despite their having been no offer of delivery
of possession of fully developed plots.
9.   We, therefore,  hold that  the interest  in the present
and similar cases had become due from 17th October, 1980. We
understand from  Shri Bhandare  that most  of the members of
the appellant-Association  had  paid  the  instalments  with
interest as per the notice of the respondent No.2. According
to us,  as interest  became chargeable  from  17th  October,
1980, it  would be open to the members of the Association to
claim refund  if they  had paid  interest, as claimed in the
notices issued by the respondent No.2.
10.  We do  not propose  to leave  the matter  at this.  The

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

allotments having been made about two decades ago, there can
be no  justification in  not fully developing the plots even
by 1992.  The statement in I.A. No.2 of 1992 that the sector
is ""almost fully developed"" and that ""temporary disposal has
been completed""  do speak  about lack of proper interest and
attention on the part of the respondents. In this connection
we would  state that  a statement had been made on behalf of
the  respondents   before  this   Court  on  14.1.1985  that
possession of  the developed  plots would  be given  to  the
appellants within  a period  of six  months, and  so such  a
direction was  given. Shri Bhandare states that direction is
yet to  be complied  with in  letter and  spirit. It is this
complaint which has given rise to Contempt Petition No.22 of
1989. On  the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not
propose to  pursue the contempt application and would direct
the respondents  once again to develop the sector fully, and
not, ""almost  fully"". This  would be done within a period of
six months,  failing which the respondents would not only be
liable for  contempt but  the allottees  would be exonerated
from the liability to pay any interest whatsoever.
11.  The appeal  is disposed  of  accordingly,  without  any
order as to costs."

     Substitution allowed.
     This Court while disposing of the matter by order dated
July 20,  1988 directed  that depending upon the decision of
the Constitution  Bench in Union of India vs. Raghubir Singh
[(1989) 3 SCR 316], the payment of the interest and solatium
would be  determined. Since there the Constitution Bench had
concluded that  the  claimants  would  be  entitled  to  the
statutory benefits  under Amendments  Act 60  of 1984 if the
proceedings are  pending before the Land Acquisition Officer
or Civil  Court between  April  30,  1984,  i.e.,  when  the
Amendment Act  68 of 1984 was introduced on the floor of the
Parliament and  the date  when the  Act came  into force  in
September 24, 1984. Admittedly, the award came to be made on
August 30,  1982 and  the supplementary award with regard to
the trees etc., came to be made on December 27, 1982.
     Under these  circumstances, the  petitioners  would  be
entitled to  payment of  solatium under Section 23 [2] @ 30%
per annum  on enhanced  compensation. As regards the payment
of interest  under Section  28 of  the Land  Acquisition At,
1894 and  the additional  amount under  Section 23  [1-A] of
that Act, admittedly, the petitioners remained in possession
of the  acquired land.  Under Sections  34, 28  and 23 [1-A]
payment of  interest and  additional amount  was intended to
mitigate the  hardship caused to the owner by deprivation of
enjoyment of  their property,  after possession  was  taken.
Since the  possession was  admittedly with  the petitioners,
they are  not entitled  to payment of interest under Section
34, 28  or additional  amount  under  Section  23  [1-A]  as
amended by Act 68 of 1984.
     The Land  Acquisition Officer will determine the amount
of solatium  payable to  the petitioners  within a period of
four weeks  from the  date of  the receipt of this order and
within six  weeks thereafter  the amount so determined would
be paid  to the  petitioners. Before making the payment, the
petitioners shall  hand over  the  possession  to  the  Land
Acquisition Officer.
     The petitions are ordered accordingly. No costs.

     Permission to file S.L.P. Is granted.
     Leave granted.
     Since the  first respondent  now  stands  retired  from
service, no  useful purpose  will be  served to continue the
proceedings pursuant  to the  show cause  notice  which  was
quashed by  the High  Court. No doubt the High Court was not
justified in  exercising its  power to nip the action in the
bud at the notice stage itself. As regards the law, recently
this Court  has considered  the controversy and laid the law
in Kumari  Madhuri Patil vs. Additional Commissioner [(1994)
6 SCC  241] and  Director of  Tribal Welfare,  Government of
A.P. vs.  Laveti Giri & Anr. [JT 1995 (3) SC 684]. The ratio
of the High Court decision is no longer good law.
     Under these  circumstances, we  think  that  no  useful
purpose will be served to continue the proceedings. However,
if the children of the first respondent lay any claim on the
basis that  they are  Scheduled Tribes,  it would be open to
the appropriate  authorities to take appropriate decision or
action as is warranted under law.
     The appeal is disposed of with the above observations."

HEADNOTE:
JUDGMENT:
                      J U D G M E N T
AHMADI, CJI :
1.   The short  but interesting question that arises for our
consideration is :-
     ""Whether the Awards, Bharat Ratna, Padma
     Vibhushan, Padma  Bhushan and Padma Shri
     (hereinafter   called    ""The   National
     Awards"") are ""Titles"" within the meaning
     of Article  18(1) of the Constitution of
     India?""
2.   Before dealing  with the  legal aspects of the question
at issue,  we may  briefly set out the factual matrix of the
two cases.  The two  petitions which have given rise to this
issue were  filed in  the High  Courts of  Kerala and Madhya
Pradesh (Indore  Bench),  respectively.  The  petitioner  in
T.C.(C)  No.9/94,   Balaji  Raghavan   (hereinafter   called
’Petitioner No.1’)  had  filed  O.P.No.2110/92  (hereinafter
called ’the  O.P’) on  February 13,  1992 before  the Kerala
High Court.  The petition  filed under  Article 226  of  the
Constitution, sought,  by way  of a  writ  of  mandamus,  to
prevent the  respondent from  conferring any of the National
Awards.  The  petitioner  in  T.C.(C)  No.1/95,  S.P.  Anand
(hereinafter called  ’petitioner No.2’) filed Misc. Petition
No.1900//92 (hereinafter  called ’the  M.P.’) on  August 24,
1992, before  the Indore  Bench of  the Madhya  Pradesh High
Court, praying for the same relief.
3.   In the  Kerala High  Court, the  two contesting parties
filed written submissions and counters between September 30,
1992 and  April 7,  1994. During this period, the High Court
of Kerala  did not  hear oral  arguments or pass any interim
order. However,  in the  other case, a Division Bench of the
High Court  of Madhya  Pradesh (Indore Bench), on August 25,

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 14 
1992, through  an  ex-parte  order,  issued  notice  to  the
respondent and  also restrained  it from  conferring on  any
person or  persons any of the National Awards, until further
orders. The  respondent filed  T.P.(C) Nos.6 & 7 before this
Court, seeking  to transfer  the case  and to vacate the ex-
parte order of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh dated August
25, 1992.  On January  8, 1993,  a Division  Bench  of  this
Court, while  refusing  to  transfer  the  case  to  itself,
directed the  Madhya Pradesh High Court to give its decision
on the  application filed by the respondent for vacating the
ex-parte order,  on or  before January  20, 1993. On January
20, 1993,  a Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court
vacated its  earlier order dated August 25, 1992. Meanwhile,
the respondent  filed T.P.(C)  No.811-812/93,  by  which  it
sought transfer of both the O.P. and the M.P. to this Court.
On October 29, 1993, a Division Bench of this Court directed
that the  matter be  posted before  a bench presided over by
the Chief Justice of India on January 17, 1994. On that day,
a bench  of this  Court presided  over  by  the  then  Chief
Justice issued  notice in  T.P.  Nos.811-812/93  and  stayed
further proceedings  in both  the petitions. Later, on March
7, 1994,  this Court transferred both the aforesaid cases to
itself.
4.   Thereafter, on September 11, 1995, T.C.(C) Nos.9/94 and
1/95 were  posted before a Division Bench of this Court. The
last date for submission of written briefs by both sides was
fixed and  each side  was allotted  time for oral arguments.
While counsel  for the  petitioner No.1  and the  respondent
submitted their  written briefs  within the stipulated time,
the petitioner  No.2, however, failed to do so. The date for
the hearing  before this  Constitution Bench  was fixed  for
November 14, 1995. On October, 31, 1995, the petitioner No.2
was given  notice of  this fact. However, he did not present
himself before  the Constitution Bench and no arguments were
advanced on  his behalf.  Subsequently, after the conclusion
of the  hearing and  the judgment  being reserved,  he  sent
communications dated  November 1, 1995 and November 6, 1995,
which were  received by  the Supreme  Court on  November 15,
1995 and November 21, 1995 respectively, requesting that his
petition should  be delisted  or else  he should  be given a
hearing by  the Constitution  Bench. It  is not  possible to
accede to  his request.  A public  interest litigant  cannot
choose his  forum. Once  the case  stands transferred to the
Supreme Court,  he must make arrangements to present himself
and advance arguments before it. A Constitution Bench cannot
be expected to fix its schedule with a view to accommodating
each and  every litigant. Litigants must conform to the time
schedule fixed  by the  Court.  Hence  we  have  refused  to
entertain his request.
5.   It would now be relevant to notice the events connected
with the institution of the National Awards. It is important
to note  that a  policy of  instituting National  Awards and
Honours had  been adopted  even before  the Constitution  of
India was  formally drafted. On February 13, 1948, the Prime
Minister’s Committee  on Honours and Awards was set up under
the  Chairmanship  of  the  Constitutional  Adviser  to  the
Government of  India, Sir  B.N. Rau.  It’s  purpose  was  to
recommend the  number  and  nature  of  civil  and  military
awards; the  machinery for  making recommendations  for  the
granting of these awards; the frequency with which they were
to be awarded, etc. The Committee worked on the premise that
orders and decorations, carrying no title, were not meant to
be prohibited.  It submitted its report on March 9, 1948 and
gave  extensive  suggestions  in  respect  of  each  of  the
subjects upon  which  it  had  been  required  to  give  its

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 14 
recommendations. Thereafter,  in a  series of  meetings held
between May,  30, 1948 and October 29, 1953, the Cabinet had
occasion  to  discuss  the  nature  and  conditions  of  the
proposed National Awards.
6.   The  National   Awards  were   formally  instituted  in
January,  1954   by  two  Presidential  Notifications  No.1-
Pres./54 and  No.2-Pres./54 dated January 2, 1954 which were
subsequently superseded  by four  fresh Notifications, viz.,
No.1-Pres./55, 2-Pres./55,  3-Pres./55 and  4-Pres./55 dated
January 8,  1955. The purpose for which these awards were to
be given are as follows:-
NAME OF THE AWARD        PURPOSE FOR WHICH IT IS GIVEN
-----------------        -----------------------------
Bharat Ratna             For exceptional Service towards the
                         advancement  of  art, literature  &
                         science & in  recognition of public
                         service  of  the  highest order.
Padma Vibhushan          For exceptional  and  distinguished
                         service  in  any  field   including
                         service rendered by Govt. servants.
Padma Bhushan            For distinguished service of a high
                         order in any  field  including  the
                         service rendered by Govt. servants.
Padma Shri               For distinguished  service  in  any
                         field including service rendered by
                         Govt. servants.
     The  aforementioned   Presidential  Notifications  also
provide  that  any  person,  without  distinction  of  race,
occupation, position  or sex,  shall be  eligible for  these
awards  and   also  that  the  decorations  may  be  awarded
posthumously.
7.   A press  Note was  issued by the Government of India on
April 17,  1968 making  it clear  that the practice of using
Civilian Awards, such as, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Bhushan and
Padma Shri,  as titles  on  letterheads,  invitation  cards,
posters,  books,   etc.,  is   against  the  scheme  of  the
Government as  the awards are not titles and their use along
with the  names of  individuals is contrary to the spirit of
the Constitution  which has  abolished titles.  It was  also
emphasised in the press note that civilian awards should not
be attached  as suffixes  or prefixes  to the  names of  the
awardees to give them the appearance of titles.
8.   In the  year 1969  and again in the year 1970, the late
Acharya J.B.  Kripalani, who  was then  a Member  of the Lok
Sabha, moved a non-official Bill entitled ’The Conferment of
Decoration on  Persons (Abolition)  Bill,  1969’  for  their
abolition. In  the draft  statement of  Objects and  Reasons
appended to the Bill, the main points were thus stated:-
a)   Although Article  18 had  abolished titles,  they  were
     sought to be brought in by the back door in the form of
     decorations.
b)   The decorations  were not  always awarded  according to
     merit, and  the Government  of the  day is not the best
     Judge of the merits or the eminence of the recipient.
c)   These ""new  titles"" were  at first  given to  very few,
     exceptional persons; this small stream had since become
     quite a flood.
     The Bill  led to  an elaborate debate in Parliament but
was ultimately defeated.
9.   On August  8, 1977,  the institution  of  the  National
Awards was  cancelled, vide  Notification No.65-Pres/77.  On
January 25,  1980 the  Government revived  these  awards  by
Notification  No.25-Pres./80  which  cancelled  the  earlier
Notification No.65-Pres./77  dated  August  8,  1997.  Since
then, the  National Awards  have been  conferred annually on

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 14 
the Republic Day.
10.  We may  now refer  to the  text of  Article 18  of  the
Constitution which reads as follows :
     ""18. Abolition of titles. -(1) No title,
     not  being   a  military   or   academic
     distinction, shall  be conferred  by the
     State.
     (2)  No citizen  of India  shall  accept
     any title from any foreign State.
     (3)  No person  who is  not a citizen of
     India shall,  while he  holds any office
     of profit  or  trust  under  the  State,
     accept  without   the  consent   of  the
     President any  title  from  any  foreign
     State.
     (4)  No person  holding  any  office  of
     profit under  the State  shall,  without
     the consent of the President, accept any
     present, emolument,  or  office  of  any
     kind from or under any foreign State.""
11.  The learned  counsel for  petitioner No.1  pointed  out
that  while   Article  18(1)  prohibits  the  conferment  of
‘titles’ by  the State  with the  exception of  military and
academic distinctions, it does not define the words ""titles""
and ""distinction"".  In an  effort to  throw light  upon this
aspect, he  referred us  to the  legislative history  of the
provision. According to him, the framers of the Constitution
had intended  to do  away with  the practice followed by the
British of  conferring various ’titles’ upon Indian citizens
who  curried   favour  with  them.  This  practice  and  the
recipients of  the titles  had earned  the contempt  of  the
people of  pre-independent India  and hence  such pernicious
practices were  proposed to  be  prohibited  in  Independent
India through  this  provision.  According  to  him,  viewed
against this  background, the  word ’title’  should be given
the widest  possible meaning  and amplitude in order to give
effect to  the legislative  intent. Since the only exception
to this  rule has been carved out in respect of military and
academic   distinctions,   it   follows   that   all   other
distinctions are impliedly prohibited. We were then referred
to several  dictionaries to  ascertain the  meaning  of  the
words   ""Title"",   ""Order"",   ""Distinction"",   ""Award""   and
""Designation"". It  was sought  to be  demonstrated that even
the dictionary meaning of the word ’title’ is wide enough to
encompass all other similar concepts.
12.  It was  further contended that the National Awards make
distinctions  according  to  rank.  They  are  divided  into
superior and  inferior classes and the holders of the Bharat
Ratna have  been assigned  the 9th  place in  the Warrant of
Precedence  (which   indicates   the   rank   of   different
dignitaries and high officials of the State). It was pointed
out that  several recipients  were following the practice of
appending these  awards to their names, using them as titles
in their letter-heads, publications and at public functions.
This practice  has continued  unabated despite the fact that
the Government  had issued  a Press Note in 1968 prohibiting
such conduct.  Says the  learned counsel,  all these factors
have resulted  in the  creation of  a rank of persons on the
basis of recognition by the State, in the same manner as was
achieved by  the conferment  of nobility  during the British
rule. This,  according  to  him,  is  clearly  violative  of
Article 14  read with the Preamble to the Constitution which
guarantee to  every citizen, equality of status. It was also
pointed out  that there  are no objective guidelines for the
manner in which the recipients are to be chosen and over the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 5 of 14 
years, these  awards have degenerated into rewards proffered
by the  powers that  be i.e.,  the Government of the day, in
great numbers, to those who serve their political ends.
13.  The learned  Attorney General  for India  prefaced  his
arguments on  behalf of  the Union  of India by stating that
almost every  country in  the world,  including  those  with
republican and socialist constitutions, follows the practice
of conferring  awards for  meritorious services  rendered by
its citizens.  The  learned  counsel  then  referred  us  to
several dictionaries  for the  meanings of ""Title"", ""Award"",
""Distinction"", ""Decoration""  and  ""Order"".  He  then  stated
that, according  to the  ordinary and  contextual meaning in
Article 18,  the word ""title"" means a title of honour, rank,
function  or   office  in   which  there  is  a  distinctive
appellation. An  appellation, according to him, is a name or
title by  which a person is called or known, something which
is  normally   prefixed  or   suffixed,  for  example,  Sir,
K.C.I.E., Maharaja,  Nawab, Dewan  Bahadur, etc. The learned
counsel submitted  that it is these appellations that appear
as prefixes  or suffixes  which are sought to be interdicted
by Article  18(1). Since  the National Awards are not titles
of nobility  and are not to be used as suffixes or prefixes,
they are  not prohibited  by Article  18. In this regard, we
were referred  to the Press Note dated April 17, 1968 issued
by the  Government of  India. The  learned  counsel  further
submitted that  the words  ""not being a military or academic
distinction"" in  Article 18  have  been  used  ex  abundanti
cautela. Since  military and academic distinctions, such as,
General, Colonel,  Professor, Mahavir  Chakra, B.A., etc. do
carry suffixes or prefixes, the framers of the Constitution,
by way  of abundant  caution, expressly  mentioned that they
would be exempted. It follows that distinctions which do not
carry suffixes  or prefixes  will not  be  affected  by  the
interdiction in  Article 18(1).  At this  stage, the learned
counsel  took   us  through   the  relevant   parts  of  the
discussions in  the Constituent  Assembly that  led  to  the
framing of Article 18(1) to support the aforesaid stance.
14.  The  learned   Attorney  General  then  reiterated  his
argument that  republican  nations  across  the  world  have
similar awards  for  recognizing  meritorious  services  and
these National  Awards are  not violative  of the  right  to
equality as  enshrined in  Part III  of the Constitution. In
this context,  we were  referred to  civil awards instituted
and conferred  by the  United Kingdom,  the United States of
America, the  Republic of  France, the  peoples Republic  of
China, the  Republic of  Canada and the former Soviet Union.
In response  to our  query for  guidelines that  control the
manner of  selection of  the recipients of these awards, the
learned Attorney  General delivered  to us  a  copy  of  the
communique that  was sent  to him  from the Ministry of Home
Affairs in this regard.
15.  Mr. Santosh  Hegde, Senior  counsel, responded  to  our
request to  act as  amicus  curiae  and  advanced  arguments
before us.  He began  by stating  that the  fact that  these
awards are  being grossly  misused had occasioned one of the
writ petitions.  He referred  us to  the  views  of  eminent
authors, Mr.  D.D. Basu and Mr. H.M. Seervai on the issue at
hand. Thereafter,  he led  us through  the relevant parts of
the  discussions   in  the   Constituent   Assembly   before
submitting that  it is  clear  that  the  Constitution  does
envisage a  situation where meritorious services rendered by
individuals are  to be  recognised by the State, through the
conferment of  awards. However,  to avoid  the criticism  of
creating a separate class, it needs to be ensured that these
awards are  not used  as prefixes  or suffixes. He concurred

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 6 of 14 
with the submission of the learned Attorney General that the
words ""military  or academic  distinction"" had  been used by
way of  abundant caution.  Commenting on the misuse of these
awards, he  submitted that the maximum number of awards that
can be  conferred should  be specified.  He also  felt  that
ordinarily, public servants and civil servants should not be
eligible for  these awards,  unless there  are extraordinary
reasons.
16.  We may  now address  the central  issue in the case. At
the outset,  we may  point out  that the marginal heading of
Article 18,  which reads  as ""Abolition  of  Titles""  is  an
incorrect summarization  of its contents as it does not seek
to abolish  titles granted  in the  past. Sir Ivor Jennings,
the noted constitutional lawyer, has described Article 18 as
""not a  right at  all, but  a restriction  on executive  and
legislative power.""
17.  From the  aforementioned discussion,  two views  on the
proper interpretation of Article 18(1) emerge:-
1)   The first,  put forth  by the  petitioners, is that the
word ’title’  in Article 18(1) is used in an expansive sense
to include  awards,  distinctions,  orders,  decorations  or
titles of  any sort whatsoever, except those that qualify as
military or academic distinctions.
2)   The second,  advanced by  the learned  Attorney General
and Mr.  Santosh  Hegde,  is  that  what  is  sought  to  be
prohibited are  titles of  nobility  and  those  that  carry
suffixes or  prefixes, which violate the concept of equality
by creating  a separate  class. According  to this view, the
words ""military  or academic  distinction"" were added by way
of abundant  caution. It  was not meant to prevent the State
from honouring  or recognizing  meritorious or  humanitarian
services rendered by citizens.
18.  We may  now refer  to the  developments  preceding  the
introduction of Article 18(1) as it presently stands and the
debates thereon amongst the framers of the Constitution. The
Constituent  Assembly,   as  we   all  know,  functioned  by
constituting Committees  which were  expected to  deliberate
and take  decisions on specific issues of Constitutional law
to be incorporated in the Constitution. On January 21, 1947,
three such  Committees were constituted by the Assembly, one
of them  being the Advisory Committee on Fundamental Rights,
Minorities  and  Tribals  and  Excluded  Areas  (hereinafter
called ""The  Advisory  Committee  on  Fundamental  Rights"").
Thereafter, the Assembly met at regular intervals to discuss
the reports  submitted by  the various Committees. On August
29, 1947,  the Assembly appointed a Drafting Committee which
was to analyse the reports of these Committees, take note of
the discussions  in the Assembly regarding them, and prepare
the text  of a  Draft Constitution.  This Draft Constitution
came to be prepared during February 1948 and on November 15,
1948,  the   clause-by-clause  discussion   of   the   Draft
Constitution began  in the Assembly. This process culminated
on November 26, 1949 when the Constitution as settled by the
Constituent Assembly was adopted by it.
19.  The provision  that is now Article 18 (1) was discussed
and formulated  in the  report of  the Advisory Committee on
Fundamental Rights.  This Committee had, in view of its wide
agenda, appointed  two Sub-Committees,  one  on  Fundamental
Rights and the other on Minorities. The former Sub-Committee
was chaired  by Acharya  J.B. Kripalani.  On March 25, 1947,
the present  Article 18(1)  was discussed for the first time
in the  Sub-Committee on  Fundamental Rights. The agenda for
the meeting  was the  discussion of the note prepared by Mr.
K.T. Shah on Fundamental Rights which contained five clauses
relating to  the prohibition  of, and  restrictions on,  the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 7 of 14 
conferment and  acceptance of  titles, honours, distinctions
and privileges. Clause 3 of this note read:-
     ""No artificial  or man-made  distinction
     between citizens and citizens, by way of
     titles, honours,  privileges  -  whether
     personal  or  inheritable,  -  shall  be
     recognised by and enforceable under this
     Constitution, or  laws made  thereunder:
     provided that academic degrees, official
     titles, or  popular honorifics,  whether
     of  Indian   or   foreign   origin,   or
     conferment, may  be permitted  in so far
     as they  create no  privileged class  or
     heritable distinction.""
     At the  meeting, Mr.  K.T. Shah  formally proposed  the
abolition of  titles  and  the  privileged  class  of  title
holders. In  the final  report  of  the  Sub-Committee,  the
relevant part of Clause 8 read as follows :
     ""No  titles  except  those  denoting  an
     office  or   a   profession   shall   be
     conferred by the Union.""
20.  This clause was considered by the Advisory Committee on
Fundamental  Rights   on  April   21,  1947.   A  number  of
influential  members   expressed  reservations   about   the
abolition of  titles. Mr.  C. Rajagopalachari suggested that
it should  be left  open to  the legislature  to decide from
time to time whether titles are good or bad. He stated that,
especially  if   there  was   a  nationalist,  communist  or
socialist policy,  and the  profit motive was removed, there
would be  a great necessity for creating a new motive in the
form of  titles. Sir  Alladi Krishnaswamy  Aiyar and  Mr. M.
Ruthnaswamy also  supported the omission of this clause. The
latter stated  that equality  is not  opposed to distinction
and even in a democracy, it must be provided. Mr. K.T. Shah,
however,  urged  that  the  conferring  of  titles  offended
against the  fundamental principle  of equality sought to be
enshrined in  the Constitution.  Mr.  K.M.  Panikkar,  while
suggesting a half-way solution stated:-
     ""Orders   and    decorations   are   not
     prohibited. The  heritable titles by the
     Union undoubtedly  create inequality. In
     the Soviet Union many encouragements are
     given on  account  of  certain  national
     policies. What  I am  submitting is that
     we must make a clear distinction between
     titles which  are heritable  and thereby
     create inequality  and titles  given  by
     governments for the purpose of rewarding
     merit or by recognising merit. There are
     two methods  that exist. As you know one
     is by title and the other by decoration.
     What we  have to  aim at  is really  the
     question  of  heritable  titles  and  we
     should see  that provision  is made  for
     decorations  and  various  other  things
     because it is only titles that have been
     prohibited,    not    decorations    and
     honours.""
                             (Emphasis added)
     Pressed to  a vote,  the  suggestion  that  the  clause
should be  omitted was  lost by  14 votes  to  10;  but  Mr.
Panikkar’s proposal  that only  heritable titles  should  be
forbidden was  accepted by  Mr.  Shah  and  was  unanimously
adopted by  the Committee.  The relevant part of Clause 7 of
the Committee’s  Interim Report  to the Constituent Assembly

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 8 of 14 
read :
     ""No heritable  title shall  be conferred
     by the Union.""
21.  On April  30, 1947,  this clause  was discussed  in the
Constituent  Assembly.   While  moving   the   clause,   Mr.
Vallabhbhai Patel  observed that  titles  were  often  being
abused for  corrupting the  public life  of the country and,
therefore, it  was better  that their  abolition  should  be
provided as  a fundamental  right. He  informed the Assembly
that it  had been decided to drop the word ’heritable’ as it
had  become  a  matter  of  controversy.  While  moving  the
amendment, Mr. M.R. Masani stated :
     ""This will  mean that  the  free  Indian
     State will  not confer any titles of any
     kind, whether  heritable  or  otherwise,
     that is,  for the life of the incumbent.
     It may  be possible  for  the  Union  to
     honour  some   of   its   citizens   who
     distinguish themselves  in several walks
     of life  like science and the arts, with
     other kinds  of honours not amounting to
     titles; but  the idea  of a  man putting
     something before  or after his name as a
     reward for  service rendered will not be
     possible in a free India.""
                             (Emphasis added)
     While supporting the amendment, Sri Prakasa stated:
     ""Sir, I  should like  to make  it  plain
     that this  clause does not prohibit even
     the  State   from  bestowing   a  proper
     honour. We  are  distinguishing  between
     titles and honours. A title is something
     that hangs  to one’s  name. I understand
     it is a British innovation. Other States
     also honour their citizens for good work
     but those  citizens do  not  necessarily
     hang their  titles  to  their  names  as
     people in  Britain  or  British-governed
     parts of  the world do. That is all that
     this     clause      seeks     to     do
     ........................  we   want   to
     abolish   this   corroding,   corrupting
     practice  which   makes  individuals  go
     about currying  favour with authority to
     get particular distinctions.""
                             (Emphasis added)
     While opposing  the amendment,  Seth Govind Das and Mr.
H.V. Kamath  complained that  the clause  covered  only  the
future conferment  of titles  and that it was necessary also
to  abolish   titles  conferred   earlier  by   the   ""alien
imperialist Government"".  Mr. Vallabhbhai  Patel in replying
to the  debate referred  to the  point raised by Seth Govind
Das and  Mr. Kamath. Pleading for forgetting ""all about past
titles"", he  said that  the Assembly  was really legislating
for the  future and  not for  the past;  some people who had
obtained titles  from the  British Government after they had
""spent so  much"" and  ""worked so  hard"" for  them, should be
left alone; disturbing their titles might be ""interpreted as
a sign of spiteful feeling"".
     After the acceptance of the amendment moved by Mr. M.R.
Masani the relevant part of the clause read as follows :
     ""No title shall be conferred by the Union.""
22.  With a  minor modification,  the provision  appeared as
Article 12(1)  in the  Draft Constitution  prepared  by  the
Drafting Committee:-

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 9 of 14 
     ""Article 12(1)  - No  title shall  be conferred  by the
State.""
23.  The Drafting Committee and its Special Committee, after
considering the various comments, suggestions and amendments
received on  draft article 12, suggested further amendments.
The Constitutional  Advisor, Sir  B.N. Rau,  supported these
new amendments and stated:
     ""Presumably  it  is  not  intended  that
     titles   such    as   ""Field   Marshal"",
     ""Admiral"",   ""Air    Marshal"",    ""Chief
     Justice""  or   ""Doctor""  indicating   an
     office   or    profession,   should   be
     discontinued. It may be pointed out that
     the term  ""State""  as  defined  includes
     ""all local  or other  authorities within
     the   territory    of    India"".    Nor,
     presumably, is  it intended  to prohibit
     the award  of medals  or decorations for
     gallantry, humanitarian  work, etc.  not
     carrying any title.""
     The Drafting Committee redrafted Article 12(1) to read:
     ""Hereditary titles  or other  privileges
     of birth  shall not  be conferred by the
     State.""
24.  It is  important to  note that  when, on  November  30,
1948, draft  article 12  came up for final discussion before
the Constituent  Assembly, Dr.  Ambedkar did  not  move  the
amendment for  redrafting clause  (1) of  Draft  Article  12
which had earlier been accepted by the Drafting Committee.
     The Draft  article, as  presented to the Assembly, read
as it was framed originally by the Drafting Committee :-
""1) No title shall be conferred by the State.""
     Mr. T.T.  Krishnamachari sought  to add  the words ""not
being a  military or  academic distinction""  after the  word
title in  clause (1).  He  felt  that  this  was  necessary,
firstly,  because   certain  types   of  titles  had  to  be
permitted,  the  Government  having,  for  example,  already
decided to  confer certain  military distinctions; secondly,
because the  State might  decide to  revive academic  titles
like Mahamahopadhyaya,  and  lastly,  because  a  university
might not be completely divorced from a State in view of the
definition of  the latter in draft article 7. (Article 12 of
the Constitution).
25.  The  amendment  moved  by  Mr.T.T.  Krishnamachari  was
accepted by the Constituent Assembly on December 1, 1948 and
the final clause [later renumbered by the Drafting Committee
as Article 18(1)] read as it does today.
     Note: The  quotations  that  appear  in  the  preceding
paragraphs have  been extracted  from Volumes III and VII of
the Constituent  Assembly Debates  and from  ""The Framing of
India’s Constitution"", a study in five volumes, edited by B.
Shiva Rao.
26.  We may  also refer  to the  views expressed by Sir B.N.
Rau. As already stated, he was appointed the Chairman of the
Prime Minister’s  Committee on  Awards and Honours which was
appointed as  early as in 1948. At the very first meeting of
the Committee,  one of  the members  raised the issue of the
validity of  the proposed  awards, in  view of Article 12 of
the Draft  Constitution which  sought to abolish titles. Sir
B.N. Rau, who had, in his capacity as Member of the Drafting
Committee contributed  to  the  discussion  regarding  Draft
Article 12,  pointed out  that ’titles’  did not necessarily
include all orders and distinctions. He referred to the U.S.
Constitution which  forbids the  grant of titles of nobility
but allows  decorations such  as the  Congressional Medal of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 10 of 14 
Honour and  the Distinguished  Service Cross. He stated that
in Constitutions  where orders  and decorations  as well  as
titles are  intended to  be prohibited,  separate mention is
usually made, as had been done in Article 73 and Article 109
of the Danzig and Weimar Constitutions respectively.
27.  We may  now refer  to the  constitutional provisions of
certain other  countries analogous  to Article  18(1) of our
Constitution:
1.   Article 73  of the Danzig Constitution (as it then was)
read :
""Titles- with  the exception of academic degrees:- shall not
be  awarded   except  when   they  denote  an  office  or  a
profession.
Orders and Decorations may not be awarded by the free State.
No national of Danzig may accept titles or orders.:""
     2.The Constitution  of The United States
     of America, 1787.
     Article 1,  Section 9  Clause (8)  : ""No
     title of  nobility shall  be granted  by
     the United States; and no person holding
     any office of profit or trust under them
     shall, without  consent of the Congress,
     accept any  present, emolument,  office,
     or title  of any  kind whatever from any
     King, Prince, or foreign State.""
     3.The Constitution of Japan.
     Article XIV  : ""Peers  and Peerage shall
     not be  recognised. No  privilege  shall
     accompany   any    award   of    honour,
     decoration or any distinction, nor shall
     any such  award be valid beyond the life
     time of  the  individual  who  holds  or
     hereafter may receive it.""
     4.The Constitution  of the  Republic  of
     Ireland, 1937
     Section 40  (2) : ""1. Titles of nobility
     shall not be conferred by the State.
     2. No title of nobility or of honour may
     be accepted  by any  citizen except with
     the prior approval of the Government.""
     Similar provisions are to be found in :
     (i) Article  3, Section  1,  Sub-section
     (9) of  the Constitution of Philippines,
     1935;
     (ii) Article  78 of  the Constitution of
     Iceland, 1944;
     and
     (iii)  Article   109   of   the   Weimar
     Constitution, 1919.
28.  From the  discussion in the preceding paragraphs, it is
clear that  in enacting  Article 18(1),  the framers  of the
Constitution sought  to put  an end to the practice followed
by the  British in  respect of  conferment of  titles. They,
therefore, prohibited  titles  of  nobility  and  all  other
titles that carry suffixes or prefixes as they result in the
creation of  a distinct  unequal class of citizens. However,
the framers  did  not  intend  that  the  State  should  not
officially recognise  merit  or  work  of  an  extraordinary
nature. They,  however, mandated  that the honours conferred
by the  State should  not be  used as  suffixes or prefixes,
i.e., as titles, by the recipients.
29.  Awards of  this nature  are conferred by many countries
around the  world. Even  countries such as the United States
of  America,   whose  Constitutions   specifically  bar  the
conferment of  titles of  nobility, follow  the practice  of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 11 of 14 
regularly conferring civil awards. In the United States, the
Presidential Medal  of Freedom,  instituted in 1957, honours
Americans and  others who  make exceptional contributions to
national security  or interest,  world peace, culture and so
forth. In  France, the  Palmes Academiques  is  awarded  for
merit in  teaching and  for literature,  science  and  other
cultural activities.  There are also other awards for social
merit, public  health, tourism, craftsmanship, postal merit,
etc. The Canadian Government established the Order of Canada
in 1967  and it  is awarded  for a  wide variety  of  fields
including agriculture,  ballet, medicine, philanthropy, etc.
The Order  of  Canada  has  three  levels  of  membership  -
Companion, Officer  and Member.  The total  number of living
companions may  not at  any time exceed 150. No more than 15
Companions, 46  Officers and  92 Members may be appointed in
any given  year. The  Order of Merit which is said to be the
inspiration behind  the National  Awards, was  instituted in
1902, and  is awarded  for outstanding  service  by  British
Scientists, writers, or other distinguished civilians. It is
limited to 24 members. It does not carry any title or rank.
30.  The National Awards are not violative of the principles
of  equality   as  guaranteed   by  the  provisions  of  the
Constitution. The  theory of  equality does not mandate that
merit  should   not  be   recognized.  Article  51A  of  the
Constitution speaks  of  the  fundamental  duties  of  every
citizen of  India. In  this context,  we may  refer  to  the
various clauses  of Article  51A and specifically clause (j)
which exhorts every citizen ""to strive towards excellence in
all spheres  of individual  and collective activity, so that
the nation  constantly rises  to higher  levels of endeavour
and achievement.""  It is,  therefore, necessary  that  there
should be  a system  of awards  and decorations to recognise
excellence in the performance of these duties.
31.  Hereditary  titles   of  nobility   conflict  with  the
principle of  equality insofar  as they  create a  separate,
identifiable class  of people who are distinct from the rest
of society  and have  access to  special privileges.  Titles
that are  not hereditary but carry suffixes or prefixes have
the same  effect, though  the degree  may be  lesser.  While
other Constitutions  also prohibit  the conferment of titles
of nobility,  ours may  perhaps be  unique in requiring that
awards conferred by the State are not to be used as suffixes
or prefixes.  This difference  is borne  out of the peculiar
problems that  these titles  had created  in pre-independent
India and  the earnest  desire of the framers to prevent the
repetition  of  these  circumstances  in  Free,  Independent
India.
32.  It has  been contended  before us  that over the years,
the purpose  for which these awards were instituted has been
diluted and  they are  granted liberally  to persons who are
undeserving of  them. The  perversion of  the system was the
motivating factor  behind the  Bill introduced in Parliament
by Acharya  Kripalani to abolish these decorations. It is to
be remembered that Acharya Kripalani was the Chairman of the
Sub-Committee  on   Fundamental  Rights  where  the  present
Article 18(1)  was originally formulated. He was, therefore,
fully aware  of the  exact import  of Article  18(1). It  is
significant that in the debates in Parliament, the thrust of
his attack  was on the misuse of these decorations. However,
it is axiomatic that the misuse of a concept does not change
its inherent  nature. The  National Awards  do not amount to
""titles"" within the meaning of Article 18(1) and they should
not be  used as  suffixes or  prefixes. If this is done, the
defaulter should forfeit the National Award conferred on him
or her by following the procedure laid down in Regulation 10

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 12 of 14 
of each  of the  four notifications  creating these National
Awards.
33.  The guidelines  contained in  the communique  from  the
Ministry of  Home Affairs  towards the selection of probable
recipients are  extremely wide, imprecise, amenable to abuse
and wholly  unsatisfactory for  the important objective that
they seek  to achieve.  There are  no limitations prescribed
for the  maximum number  of awards  that can be granted in a
given year or the maximum number that is permissible in each
category.  The   Prime  Minister’s  Committee  on  Awards  &
Honours, 1948  had recommended  certain limitations in terms
of numbers  but these  have not  been  incorporated  in  the
extant guidelines.  As stated  earlier, most  countries have
provided for  such limitations  in respect  of  their  civil
awards. That  is for  the obvious reason that the importance
of the  awards is  not diluted.  While in  the grant  of the
Bharat Ratna  award sufficient restraint has been shown, the
same cannot  be said  of all  other awards.  The exercise of
such restraint  is absolutely  necessary  to  safeguard  the
importance  of   the  awards.  That  is  why  the  need  for
necessarily  granting   awards  every   year  also  requires
reconsideration. These  and the  fixing of  other  criteria,
which will  ensure that  the recipients  of these awards are
subjected to feelings of respect rather than suspicion, need
to be  examined by  a  high  level  Committee  that  may  be
appointed by  the Prime  Minister in  consultation with  the
President of  India. Even  otherwise it  is time that such a
committee looks  into the working of the existing guidelines
in view  of the experience gained. We say no more as we have
entrusted the  task of  setting up  of the Committee to high
level functionaries.  We may only say that the Committee may
keep in  view our  anxiety that  the number of Awards should
not be  so large  as to dilute their value. We may point out
that in  some countries,  including U.S.A., the total number
of Awards to be given is restricted. With these observations
we dispose of both the petitions - cases with no order as to
costs.
34.  Before we  part with  the case, we would like to record
our appreciation  for the  assistance provided to us, at our
request, by Mr. Santosh Hegde, Senior Counsel.

Kuldip Singh, J.
     I have read the opinion proposed by A.M. Ahmadi, CJI. I
agree with  the Chief  Justice that  Bharat Ratna  and Padma
awards  are   not  ""titles""   within  Article   18  of   the
Constitution of  India. These  awards can  be given  to  the
citizens for exceptional and distinguished services rendered
in art,  literature, science  and other fields. These awards
are national  in character  and only those who have achieved
distinction at  national level  can be  considered for these
awards. The  question to  be considered, however, is whether
the purpose  of instituting  these awards  is being achieved
and these  are being conferred on the deserving persons. The
history and  experience shows  that, in the beginning, these
awards were  given to a limited number of persons but in the
recent years  there have  been floodgates  of awards for the
person who  are well  known, lesser  known and even unknown.
The Padma  awards have  been conferred  on  businessmen  and
industrialists who have multiplied their own wealth and have
hardly helped  the growth of national interest. Persons with
little  or   no  contribution  in  any  field  can  be  seen

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

masquerading as  Padma awardees.  The existing procedure for
selection of candidates is wholly vague and is open to abuse
at the  whims and  fancies  of  the  persons  in  authority.
Conferment of  Padma awards  without any firm guidelines and
fool-proof method  of selection  is bound to breed nepotism,
favoritism, patronage and even corruption.
     During the  British occupation India has had a spate of
title hunters  who brought  degradation  and  much  harm  to
healthy public  life. The  title hunters  have  always  been
considered a  menace to the safe growth of a society. Though
the Padma awards are not titles but in case these awards are
given at  the whims of the authorities - without there being
proper criteria  and method of selection - they are bound to
do more  harm to  the society  than  the  title-seekers  did
during the British regime.
     While opposing  the  Bill  titled  ""The  Conferment  of
Decorations on  Persons (Abolition)  Bill,  1969""  moved  by
Acharya J.B.  Kripalani in  the Parliament, Mr. N.K.P. Salve
in his  speech (Parliamentary  Debates, November  27,  1970)
stated as under:-
     ""SHRI N.K.P. SALVE : I am aware that the
     decorations    have     been    bestowed
     indiscriminately  on   businessmen   and
     others. In  fact, one  of my suggestions
     is that  any decoration  awarded to  any
     person  who   is  found  guilty  of  any
     ’commercial    offence’     should    be
     withdrawn.  We   should  be   extremely,
     strict    about    the    awarding    of
     decorations............   SHRI    N.K.P.
     SALVE :  I am entirely in agreement with
     Shri Madhu Limaye that some of them have
     received   these   decorations   without
     deserving them  in the  least if  at all
     they deserved anything, it was something
     else.    But    they    have    received
     decorations. In  fact, it  is within  my
     knowledge that  some of  them  have  put
     their    decorations    to    commercial
     exploitation.   In   fact,   a   certain
     managing director  of a  company wrote a
     letter  to   me  sometime  ago.  On  his
     letterhead was  written ’Ex-Rai Bahadur,
     Padma    Vibhushan’     so    and     so
     ................
     The   criteria    for   awarding   these
     decorations  are  not  very  clear.  The
     Bharat  Ratna   is  to  be  awarded  for
     exceptional    service    towards    the
     advancement  of   art,  literature   and
     science, whereas  the Padma Vibhushan is
     to  be   awarded  for   exceptional  and
     distinguished service.  Bharat Ratna  is
     for  exceptional   service   and   Padma
     Vibhushan   is   for   exceptional   and
     distinguished service.  Exceptional  and
     distinguished service  must be given the
     number one  decoration  and  not  number
     two. So,  there is  a patent  fallacy in
     this type  of criteria  which  has  been
     laid down.  It seems some bureaucrat has
     written this  without understanding  all
     these anomalies in the matter. I do hope
     that   they    do   some    amount    of
     rationalisation of this matter.""

     The above  words were  spoken in  the Parliament  about
quarter of  a century back. There has been no application of
mind at  all by the successive Governments and the system of
giving Padma  awards is getting degenerated with the passage
of time.  It has  already reached a point where political or
narrow group interests are being rewarded by those in office
for the time being.
     The  examination  of  initial  deliberations  regarding
institution of  these awards  show that in the first meeting
of the  committee  held  on  February  27,  1948  under  the
Chairmanship of  Mr. B.N.  Rau, it  was recommended  that an
extremely high  standard  should  be  prescribed  for  these
awards and  total number  of  award  to  be  given  in  each
category should  be limited  and fixed.  It was  recommended
that awards  should be  made  very  sparingly  and  only  on
grounds of outstanding merit. They should not be made merely
because  there  happen  to  be  vacancies  in  a  particular
category. The Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India,
prepared a note dated January 10, 1953 for the consideration
of the Cabinet. It was proposed to institute suitable awards
for meritorious  public services. The note clearly suggested
that the  number of  recipients in  various awards  must  be
restricted.  The   report  was  considered  by  the  Cabinet
presided over by Shri Jawaharlal Nehru and was accepted with
some minor modifications.
     Therefore,  to  ensure  that  Padma  awards  are  truly
national  in   character  and   above  party  and  political
considerations, I suggest that a committee at national level
be  constituted   by  the   Prime  Minister   of  India   in
consultation with  the President of India which may include,
among others, the Speaker of Lok Sabha, the Chief Justice of
India or his nominee and the leader of Opposition in the Lok
Sabha. At  the State  level similar committees may be formed
by the  Chief Minister of the State in consultation with the
Governor. The  committee may,  among others, include Speaker
of the  Legislative Assembly,  Chief Justice of the State or
his nominee and the leader of the Opposition.
     The function  of the  State committees  may only  be to
recommend the names of the persons, who in their opinion are
deserving of  a particular  award. The  final decision shall
have to  be taken  by the  National Committee  on Awards. No
award should  be conferred  except on  the recommendation of
the National  Committee. The  recommendation must  have  the
approval of the Prime Minister and the President of India.
     The number  of  awards  under  each  category  must  be
curtailed to  preserve their  prestige and  dignity. In  any
given year  the awards,  all put  together, may  not  exceed
fifty.
     The writ petitions are disposed of. No costs."

HEADNOTE:
JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     We have  perused the  order of  the  High  Court  dated
November 24,  1975. The  only question raised relates to the
validity of  the Ordinance  which has already been upheld by
the Full  Bench of  that Court.  It was  argued relating  to
legislative competency.  Since it  is a  matter relating  to
land reform  and land, it is covered by Schedule 7, List II,
item Nos.14  and 18. As a result, the impugned Act is within
the legislative  competence of  the State legislature. It is
then contended  that it  is violative  of Art.14. We find no
force in  the contention. Since the legislature is competent
to enact  the law,  all the  agricultural  holdings  covered
under the  Act are  equally regulated thereunder. Therefore,
there is  no discrimination  violating Art.14.  It  is  next
urged that  the procedure  prescribed is in violation of the
Code of  Civil Procedure, a Central Act. We find no force in
the  contention.  The  procedure  is  only  supplemental  or
residual to  the main  purpose of  the Act.  CPC is  in  the
Concurrent List.  The Act  received assent of the President.
The  legislature,   therefore,  is   competent  to   provide
procedure in  the implementation  of the  provisions of  the
Act. Next  submission is  that the  trial provided under the
Act is  unjust, unreasonable  and unfair.  We find  that the
summary procedure  having been prescribed for early disposal
of  these   cases,  causes   minimum  inconvenience  to  the
litigants,  which   is  just  and  fair  procedure.  It  is,
therefore, reasonable  and fair  to the  parties.  Elaborate
procedure like  trial need not necessarily be provided as is
in vogue  in civil  suits. The  time consuming  process  was
sought to  be curtailed  and fair procedure was streamlined.
As one  of its  facets it  is argued  that the Letter Patent
Appeal was  taken away under the Act and that, therefore, it
offends the  right to  fair hearing  and the CPC. We find no
force in  the contention.  Creation of  the hierarchy of the
court is  one of  legislative policy. With a view to curtail
multiplicity of  appeals, the  legislature  stepped  in  and

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
saved structural appeals. The legislature limited the remedy
by providing  for only one appeal to the High Court before a
learned single  Judge against  the orders  of the  Board  of
Revenue or  consolidation authority etc. Since that question
was  fully  canvassed  before  the  Full  Bench,  which  has
considered the same in extension and upheld the abolition of
the special  appeal, we  are in agreement with the reasoning
and conclusion of the Full Bench.
     We do  not find any justification for interference. The

                          JUDGMENT
J.S. VERMA, J. :
     This is  an appeal  by  the  returned  candidate  under
Section 116A  of the  Representation of the People Act, 1951
(for short  ""the  R.P.  Act"")  against  the  judgment  dated
5th/6th August,  1991 in Election Petition No. 21 of 1990 by
S.N. Variava,  J. of  the  Bombay  High  Court  whereby  the
election of  the appellant  to the  Maharashtra  Legislative
Assembly from  49-Kurla  Legislative  Constituency  held  on
27.2.1990 has  been declared  to be void on the ground under
Section 100(1)(b)  for commission of corrupt practices under
sub-section (3)  and (3A)  of the  R.P.  Act.  By  the  said
judgment,  the   learned  Judge  has  decided  the  election
petition and  made the  order under Section 98 declaring the
election of  the appellant  to be  void but  the findings on
issue Nos.  2 and  5 have  been reserved  for being recorded
after the  inquiry under  Section 99  of  the  R.P.  Act  is
concluded  against  Chhagan  Bhujbal,  Pramod  Mahajan,  Bal
Thackeray, Manohar Joshi and Pramod Navalkar to whom notices

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 14 
have been  issued under  Section 99  of the  R.P. Act by the
order made  therein. The  ultimate conclusion  in the  final
order made  in  the  impugned  judgment  is  quite  involved
because of the unusual mode adopted of deciding the election
petition piecemeal.  Instead of  attempting to summarise the
conclusion, it  is safer  to quote  certain portions  of the
concluding part of the judgment, as under :-
     ""I"" have  already held that the cassette
     was displayed  in the  Constituency with
     the consent  of the Respondent. There is
     however no  proof that it was personally
     exhibited by the Respondent. Accordingly
     it will have to be held that, by mode of
     display of  this  video  cassette,  some
     other persons  with the  consent of  the
     Respondent have  committed  the  corrupt
     practice of  appealing for  votes on the
     ground of the Respondent’s religion i.e.
     Hindu religion  and  have  attempted  to
     create   enmity   and   hatred   between
     different  communities   and   religions
     particularly Hindu  and Muslims. On this
     count  itself,   the  election   of  the
     Respondent   must    be    set    aside.
     Accordingly, Issues  Nos. 3  and 6  have
     been answered  in  the  Affirmative  and
     Issue Nos. 1 and 4 have been answered in
     the Negatives.
          However, before  the final order is
     passed the  last and  the main  mode  of
     canvassing i.e. by means of the speeches
     made by  Mr. Bal Thackeray and the other
     leaders of  the  Shiv  Sena  and  B.J.P.
     alliance at  the meetings  held on  29th
     January, 1990  and 24th  February, 1990,
     has to  be considered.  I have  read the
     speeches  of   Mr.  Bal  Thackeray,  Mr.
     Pramod Mahajan, Mr. Chaggan Bhujbal, Mr.
     Manohar     Mahajan,      Mr.     Pramod
     Navalkar........  On  reading  of  these
     speeches,  I   am  of   the  prima-facie
     opinion that  all the abovenamed persons
     have by  their  speeches  committed  the
     corrupt practice  of having appealed for
     votes on  the ground  of the Respondents
     community  and   religion   i.e.   Hindu
     community and  religion. They have also,
     prima-facie  at   least,  committed  the
     corrupt practice of attempting to create
     enmity  and   hatred  between  different
     classes of  citizens  on  the  basis  of
     religion  and   community,  particularly
     between  Hindus   and  Muslims.  I  have
     already set out above that in cases like
     the   present   the   consent   of   the
     Respondent can  be and  is  implied.  As
     stated above  the effect  and import  of
     the entire  speech has to be considered.
     At  this   prima-facie   stage   it   is
     therefore not  possible to pin point any
     particular portion or portions. That can
     only by  done after  hearing the  import
     and effect  and  interpretation  of  the
     speeches from  the person  who made  the
     speeches. Thus before I express my final

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 14 
     opinion I  intend to issue notices under
     Section  99  of  the  Representation  of
     People Act,  1951 to all the above named
     persons. thus the answer to Issues 2 and
     5 has been reserved till after the final
     disposal   of    the   Notices    issued
     hereunder.
          Accordingly, I direct that separate
     Notices  under   Section   99   of   the
     Representation of  People Act,  1951  be
     issued to Mr. Bal Thackeray, Mr. Manohar
     Joshi, Mr.  Chaggan Bhujbal,  Mr. Pramod
     Navalkar and  Mr. Pramod Mahajan........
     To each  Notice shall  also be annexed a
     copy of this Judgment. In each Notice it
     will be  pointed that in the Judgment it
     is  already   held  that  the  concerned
     speech/speeches were  with  the  implied
     consent of the Respondent.""
     xxx              xxx                 xxx
          ""As it  has been  held that corrupt
     practice has  been committed  by mode of
     wall  paintings  and  display  of  video
     cassettes, the petition is made absolute
     in terms of prayers (a) and (b) i.e. the
     Election  of   the  Respondent   to  the
     Maharashtra     Legislative     Assembly
     election held on 27th February, 190 from
     Constituency   No.    49   i.e.    Kurla
     Constituency is  declared  as  null  and
     void. This is on the ground that corrupt
     practice  set   out  above   under  sub-
     sections (3)  and (3A) of Section 123 of
     the Representation  of Peoples Act, 1951
     have been  proved to have been committed
     with the  consent of the Respondent i.e.
     that there  has been  an appeal  to vote
     for the  Respondent in  the name  of his
     religion  i.e.  Hindu  religion  and  an
     attempt  has   been  made   to   promote
     feelings classes of citizens of India on
     the ground of religion and community.""
                          (emphasis supplied)
     After the  impugned  judgement  was  rendered,  notices
under Section  99  of  the  R.P.  Act  were  issued  to  the
aforesaid five  persons who  then raised certain preliminary
objections to  the validity  of the  notices. Variava, J. by
his order  dated 6.1.1992  rejected  those  objections.  The
notices given  to these  persons related to certain speeches
alleged to have been made by them on 29.1.1990 and 24.2.1990
which, it  was alleged,  constituted corrupt practices under
Sections 123(3)  and 123(3A)  of the  R.P. Act.  In the said
order dated  6.1.1992, Variava,  J.  has  mentioned  certain
facts in  the background  of which  the  objections  to  the
notices under  Section 99  were considered  in  that  order.
Those facts mentioned at the outset in the said order are as
under :-
          ""Petition No.  21 of 1990 is not an
     individual Election Petition before this
     Court. In  respect of the same elections
     i.e. the  elections to  the  Maharashtra
     Legislative Assembly  held  in  February
     1990, ten such petitions have been filed
     before this  Court.  All  of  these  are
     against various successful candidates of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 14 
     Shiv Sena  and Bharatiya  Janata  Party.
     All these petitions are based on a plank
     of  Hindutva/Hinduism  alleged  to  have
     been  adopted   by  these   parties  and
     allegedly declared  by their  leaders at
     the joint  Public meetings held by these
     two parties  on 29th  January  1990  and
     24th  February   1990.  In   all   these
     petitions  the   charges  are  that  the
     respective respondents,  their  election
     agents and/or  some other  persons  have
     with  the   consent  of  the  respective
     Respondents, committed corrupt practices
     of appealing for votes on the grounds of
     the candidates  religion, community  and
     casts viz. Hindu religion, community and
     caste  and   the  corrupt   practice  of
     creating  enmity   and  hatred   between
     various  classes   of  citizens  on  the
     ground of  religion, community and caste
     particularly between Hindus and Muslims.
     Thus the  charges are under Secs. 123(3)
     and 123(3A)  of  the  Representation  of
     Peoples Act, 1951. The mode of resorting
     to these  corrupt practices have been by
     way of  speeches made  by the leaders of
     the two  parties at  the joint  meetings
     held on  29th  January,  1990  and  24th
     February,  1990,  by  use  of  offending
     poster, banners,  wall  writings  and  a
     video cassette  ""Awahan and Avhan"". This
     is  the   same  material  in  all  these
     Petitions. Then in individual Petitions,
     there are  allegations of  speeches made
     in the individual constituencies, either
     by the respective Respondent of somebody
     else with his consent.
          In this  Petition also, the charges
     against the  Respondent and  the alleged
     mode of  canvassing are  the same.  Thus
     the charge  is that  the Respondent, his
     election  agents   and/or   some   other
     persons have with his consent, committed
     the corrupt  practices of  appealing for
     votes on  the grounds of the Respondents
     religion, community and caste viz. Hindu
     religion, community  and caste  and  the
     corrupt practice  of creating enmity and
     hatred  between   various   classes   of
     citizens  on  the  ground  of  religion,
     community and caste particularly between
     Hindus and Muslims. Thus the charges are
     under Secs.  123 (3) and 123 (3A) of the
     Representation of  Peoples Act, 1951. In
     this Petition  also the  alleged mode of
     resorting to  these corrupt practices is
     by way  of speeches  made by the leaders
     of Shiv  Sena and  B.J.P. at  the  joint
     public meetings  held  on  29th  January
     1990 (at  Shivaji Park)  and by  use  of
     offending   posters,    banners,    wall
     writings and  the video cassette ‘Awahan
     and avhan’.""

     At the beginning of the impugned judgment, the scope of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN

the election  petition and  the true perspective in which it
has to be decided has been stated by Variava, J. as under :-
          ""It must  also be  noted that these
     group of petitions are to a large extent
     unlike other  election  petitions.  This
     because these  petitions are  not  based
     upon  individual  acts  of  individuals.
     They   are   mainly   based   upon   the
     abovementioned   plank   and/or   policy
     decision of  these  parties.  This  will
     have  a   bearing  on  the  question  of
     consent. It  is therefore  necessary  to
     note the make up of the Shiv Sena party.
     This already forms part of two Judgments
     of this court.""
     xxx               xxx                xxx
          "".........  Unlike  other  Election
     Petitions the  main charge  is not of an
     individual corrupt  practice committed b
     an   individual    candidate   in    his
     constituency.   really   speaking,   the
     charge  against  the  candidate  is  the
     charge  of  implementing  the  plank  as
     decided by the party........ In my view,
     in cases  like this, where the plank has
     been declared by the leader of the party
     and the leader of the party has complete
     control of  the affairs  of  the  party,
     once it  is proved  and held,  that  the
     plank declared  by the leader amounts to
     a corrupt  practice, every  candidate of
     that  party   will  be   bound  by  that
     plank...... As  is  set  out  hereafter,
     prima-facie  it  does  appear  that  the
     plank of  Hindutva/Hinduism, as declared
     by the  leaders at  these  two  meetings
     amounts  to   the  corrupt  practice  of
     appealing for  votes in  the name of the
     Hindu  candidates   religion  and   also
     amounts  to   the  corrupt  practice  of
     attempting to  create enmity  and hatred
     between different classes of citizens on
     the grounds  of community  and religion,
     particularly    between    Hindus    and
     Muslims.......""
     It is this perception of Variava, J. which has coloured
his entire  judgment and led to the decision of the election
petition, not  confined  to  the  record  of  the  case  but
extending to all the general impressions.
     An objection  expressly taken  to the  validity of  the
notices that  they could  not be  issued after  the election
petition had  been decided  by making an order under Section
98 of the R.P. Act was rejected by order dated 6.1.1992. The
connected Civil  Appeal No.  93 of  1992 by Chhagan Bhujbal,
Civil Appeal  No. 94  of 1992  by Pramod  Mahajan and  Civil
Appeal No.  2396 of 1992 by Balasaheb Thackeray, are against
the order dated 6.1.1992 passed by Variava, J. rejecting the
objections of these notices to the validity of notice issued
under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The inquiry required to be
made under  Section 99 of the R.P. Act has not yet been made
in the  High Court against any of the notices in view of the
pendency of  these appeals.  It may  be mentioned  that  two
remaining notices  Pramod Navalkar  and  Manohar  Joshi  had
filed Civil  Appeal No. 149 of 1992 and Civil Appeal No. 795
of 1992 against rejection of their objections to the notices

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 6 of 14 
but those appeals have been summarily dismissed on 19.8.1993
and  7.9.1993   apparently  leaving  open  the  question  of
validity of  the notices  to be  decided at  a later  stage.
There is no dispute at the hearing of these appeals that the
case of  all the  five notices  has to  be dealt with in the
same manner depending on the final outcome of these appeals.
     We would  now  consider  the  points  which  arise  for
decision.
Dismissal of  Election Petition under Section 86 of the R.P.
Act, 1951.
     The first  submission in  these  appeals  is  that  the
election petition  was liable  to be dismissed under Section
86 of  the R.P. Act for non-compliance of sub section (1) of
Section 81,  inasmuch as  the election  petition  was  filed
after expiry  of the  prescribed period  of 45 days from the
date of  election. Acceptance  of  the  nominations  of  the
candidates was  on 8.2.1990,  the date of poll was 27.2.1990
and the result of election was declared on 1.3.1990 at which
Ramakant Mayekar was declared elected. The election petition
was filed  on 16.4.1990. Admittedly the last date for filing
the election  petition according to the prescribed period of
45 days  was 14.4.1990,  but the  High Court  and its office
were closed  for holidays  on 14th  and 15th April, 1990 and
reopened only  on 16.4.1990.  If Section  10 of  the General
Clauses Act  applies, then  the election  petition filed  on
16.4.1990 was  within time.  We have  already  held  in  the
connected Civil  Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi vs.
Nitin Bhaurao  Patil & Anr. - decided today, that Section 10
of the  General Clauses Act applies to an election petition.
It must,  therefore, be held that this election petition was
filed within  time. This argument on behalf of the appellant
is, therefore, rejected.
Meaning and  Effect of  Sections 98  and 99 of the R.P. Act,
1951.
     The next  question for consideration is the legality of
deciding the election petition and declaring the election of
the returned  candidate to  be void by making an order under
Section 98  of the  R.P. Act,  and then  proceeding to issue
notice under Section 99 to the aforesaid five persons on the
basis of  speeches alleged  to have  been made  by  them  on
29.1.1990 and  24.2.1990 which  form the basis of the ground
under Section  100(1)(b) for  declaring the  election to  be
void. The  question really  is: Whether notice under Section
99 of the R.P. Act can be issued for commission of a corrupt
practice,  after  making  an  order  deciding  the  election
petition  and   declaring  the   election  of  the  returned
candidate to  be void?  This specific objection taken by the
notices has  been rejected  by Variava,  J. The  legality of
this view arises for consideration.
     As for  the speeches  alleged  to  have  been  made  on
29.1.1990, it  may be stated at the outset that they have to
be excluded  from consideration  since they  cannot form the
basis of  any corrupt  practice at the election, inasmuch as
they relate  to a period prior to the date on which Ramakant
Mayekar became  a candidate  at the  election as  defined in
Section 79(b)  of the R.P. Act. This is the settled position
in law.  [See Subhash  Desai vs.  Sharad J.  Rao and Others,
1994 Supp.  (2) SCC 446; Indira Nehru Gandhi vs. Raj Narain,
1975 Supp. SCC 1; Mohan Rawale vs. Damodar Tatyaba, 1994 (2)
SCC 392]. This was the undisputed position at the hearing of
these appeals before us since the speeches mad eon 29.1.1990
were prior  to the  date on  which Ramakant Mayekar became a
candidate at  the election.  It follows necessarily that the
impugned judgment  as well  as the subsequent notices issued
under Section  99 of  the R.P. Act, are unsustainable to the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 7 of 14 
extent they  are based  on the speeches alleged to have been
made on  29.1.1990. No  further discussion  is necessary for
holding that  part of  the impugned  judgment dated  5th/6th
August, 1991,  notices under  Section 99 of the R.P. Act and
the subsequent  order dated 6th January, 1992 as contrary to
law and,  therefore, liable  to be set aside for this reason
alone.
     It is  only the surviving part of the impugned judgment
and the  notices which  require further  consideration,  for
which purpose  the question for decision at the threshold is
the validity  of the course adopted of deciding the election
petition  and   declaring  the   election  of  the  returned
candidate to be void and then proceeding to give notices for
taking action under Section 99 of the R.P. Act.
     We  have  already  indicated  the  combined  effect  of
Sections 98  and 99  of the  R.P. Act in the connected Civil
Appeal No.  4973 of  1993 -  Manohar Joshi vs. Nitin Bhaurao
Patil & Anr. - decided today. The correct legal position has
been overlooked by the High Court.
     The High  Court appears to have misread the decision of
this Court in D.P. Mishra vs. Kamal Narayan Sharma and Anr.,
1971 (1)  SCR 8, to form the opinion that the course adopted
by it  was permissible under Section 99 of the R.P. Act. The
question in  that case  was of  the failure  to issue notice
under Section 99 of the R.P. Act to a person alleged to have
committed  the  corrupt  practice  for  which  the  returned
candidate also  was guilty.  The High  Court, in the appeal,
did not  comply with  the  requirement  of  Section  99  for
avoiding further  delay. This  Court rejected  that view  as
incorrect and held as under :
          ""We are  unable to  agree with  the
     view so  propounded by  the High  Court.
     Under s.  99 of the Act the Court has no
     discretion in  the matter,  if the Court
     was of  the view  that any person who is
     proved at  the trial to have been guilty
     of any  corrupt practice,  not  to  name
     that person. It is true that preliminary
     objections were  argued  at  an  earlier
     stage, but  Sharma could  not before the
     appeal was  heard ask the Court to issue
     a notice  under s.  99 of the Act on the
     footing that his case which was rejected
     by the  Tribunal will  be accepted.  The
     duty under  the Act  is  cast  upon  the
     Court or the Tribunal, and on the ground
     that the  party has  not applied  for  a
     notice, the  High Court  could not avoid
     the obligation  imposed  by  statute  to
     take proceeding  under s. 99 against the
     person proved  at the trial to have been
     guilty of  corrupt practice  and to name
     him. We  fail  also  to  appreciate  the
     ground  on  which  the  High  Court  has
     referred to  delay being an ""outweighing
     factor"". Shyamacharan Shukla was however
     not a party to the proceeding and before
     he could  be named  a notice  must go to
     him under s. 99 of the Act.
          We direct  that the  proceeding  be
     remanded to  the High Court and the High
     Court do  give  notice  to  Shyamacharan
     Shukla under s. 99 of the Representation
     of the  People Act,  1951, to appear and
     to show cause why he should not be named

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 8 of 14 
     for  committing  corrupt  practices.  If
     Shyamacharan Shukla appears in pursuance
     of the  show cause  notice  he  will  be
     entitled to  an  opportunity  of  cross-
     examining  witnesses  who  have  already
     been examined  by the  Tribunal and  has
     given evidence  against him  and he will
     be entitled  to  give  evidence  in  his
     defence and of being heard.....
                             (at pages 29-30)
     There is  nothing in  this decision to support the view
taken by  the High  Court that  it could decide the election
petition and  make an  order under  Section 98 declaring the
election of  the returned  candidate to  be  void  and  then
proceed under  Section 99  of the R.P. Act against the other
persons.
     It is,  therefore, clear  that  the  impugned  judgment
dated  5th/6th   August,  1991   declaring  the  appellant’s
election to  be void and the subsequent order dated 6.1.1992
rejecting the  preliminary objections  to the  notice issued
subsequently under  Section 99,  both by  Variava,  J.,  are
contrary to  law and  have to  be set  aside. We have not to
determine the nature of the final order to be made.
Speeches
     We have  already indicated that the speeches alleged to
have been  made on  29.1.1990 are  irrelevant and have to be
excluded from consideration as earlier stated. In respect of
the speeches  alleged to  have been  made on  24.2.1990, the
relevant portions of the impugned judgment are as under :
          ""The question  then is  whether the
     Respondent  was   also  present  at  the
     meeting held on 24th February 1990. Here
     again the  petitioner has  admitted that
     her  only   source  of   knowledge   are
     newspaper reports. In this case however,
     not a  single newspaper  report  support
     the case  that all  34  candidates  were
     present  or   that  the  Respondent  was
     present....... Thus the only evidence of
     Respondent’s presence at this meeting is
     this photo.  The court has looked at the
     photo and  the Respondent  a  number  of
     times.   It    is   not    possible   to
     categorically state  that  this  is  the
     photo of  the Respondent. If that be so,
     then the  benefit of doubt must be given
     to the  Respondent. Thus,  there  is  no
     evidence before  this court to show that
     the  Respondent   was  present   at  the
     meeting held  on 24th  February 1990. If
     that  be   so,  then   the  question  of
     considering the  Respondent’s case,  why
     he was  not present at this meeting does
     not  arise   at  all.  It  was  for  the
     petitioner to satisfy the court that the
     Respondent was  present at this meeting.
     The petitioner  has failed  to do  that.
     Therefore, so far as the meeting of 24th
     February, 1990  is concerned,  it is not
     possible to hold that the Respondent was
     present at that meeting.""
                          (emphasis supplied)
The above finding relating to speeches by some persons other
than the appellant can have relevance only if the element of
appellant’s  consent   is  also   pleaded  and  proved.  The

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 9 of 14 
appellant’s  consent   was  attempted  to  be  made  out  by
implication only from the fact of his personal presence when
those speeches  were made.  However,  the  above  conclusion
reached  by  the  High  Court  shows  that  the  appellant’s
presence at  the meeting  was not  found to  be proved. This
being so,  the element  of candidate’s  consent which  is  a
constituent part  of the  corrupt practice  alleged  on  the
basis of  speeches made  on 24.2.1990  by some other persons
has not  been found proved. That finding alone is sufficient
to reject the allegation of corrupt practice on the basis of
speeches made  by others  on 24.2.1990,  as not proved. When
this is  the conclusion  reached in respect of the appellant
himself with  regard to  the allegation  of corrupt practice
based on  speeches made  by others  on 24.2.1990,  then  the
question of  recording a  finding that  the corrupt practice
has been  proved, does not arise and, therefore, the further
question of  naming any  other person  who could  have  been
proved at  the trial  to be  guilty of  the corrupt practice
under Section 99 of the R.P. Act does not arise.
     The pleading  in respect of speeches made in the public
meeting held at Shivaji Park, Dadar on 24.2.1990 is in paras
22, 23  and generally  in para  27 of the election petition.
These are  the only  portions of  the election  petition  on
which  reliance   is  placed  by  learned  counsel  for  the
respondent as  the pleading  on this point. It is pleaded in
para 22  that the  speeches were  made by  Bal Thackeray and
other leaders  of the  alliance in  that meeting  where  the
present appellant  (respondent in the election petition) and
all other  candidates of  Shiv  Sena  -  BJP  alliance  were
present. Thereafter,  in paras  23 and  27, there  is only a
general averment  that the  appeal made by Bal Thackeray and
other leaders  to the  voters was  with the  consent of  the
appellant (respondent  in the  election petition).  No  fact
other  than   the  averment  of  personal  presence  of  the
appellant was  pleaded  to  make  out  the  consent  of  the
appellant required for constituting the corrupt practice. As
earlier indicated, the High Court has held that the presence
of the  appellant at that meeting has not been proved. Thus,
the only  basis for  pleading and  attempting to  prove  the
appellant’s consent  to the  making of those speeches in the
meeting held  on 24.2.1990  has been  held to be not proved.
There is  thus no foundation even for a tentative finding of
any corrupt  practice on  the basis  of speeches  alleged to
have been  made by  Bal Thackeray  and some other leaders in
this case  against the  present  appellant,  inasmuch  as  a
necessary ingredient  of the corrupt practice, i.e., consent
of the  appellant has  been found  to be  not proved.  There
being not  even a tentative basis to hold the charge of this
corrupt practice  proved against  the appellant, the further
question of invoking Section 99 to name any other person for
the commission  of that  corrupt  practice  along  with  the
returned candidate does not arise.
     In short,  the finding  of corrupt practice against the
appellant on the basis of speeches alleged to have been made
by  some   leaders  in   the  meeting   of  24.2.1990  being
unsustainable, this  charge has  to  fail  and  no  occasion
arises in  the present  case for  taking  any  action  under
Section 99  of the  R.P. Act.  This  part  of  the  impugned
judgment as  well as the remaining part of the notices under
Section 99 of the R.P. Act also have to be set aside.
     The only surviving question now is whether the impugned
judgment, to the extent it survives against the appellant on
the basis  of wall  paintings and  video  cassettes  can  be
sustained.
Wall Paintings

SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 10 of 14 
     After the  above conclusion  reached in  respect of the
speeches alleged  to have  been  made  by  some  leaders  on
29.1.1990 and  24.2.1990 for  the reasons already given, the
only remaining  findings of corrupt practice recorded by the
High Court  are based  on certain  wall paintings  and video
cassette which  have been  found to  constitute the  corrupt
practices under  Section 123(3) and 123(3A) of the R.P. Act.
We would now examine these findings on merits.
     The pleading  relating to  the  allegation  of  corrupt
practice based  on wall paintings is contained in para 21 of
the election petition which is as under :
          ""The  petitioner  states  that  the
     respondent  and   his  agents  with  the
     consent of the respondent have also used
     posters,  banners   and  wall  paintings
     canvassing to  vote for  the respondent,
     appealing the  voters to  vote  for  the
     respondent  in   the   name   of   Hindu
     religion. The  petitioner  has  got  the
     photographs   taken    of   such    wall
     paintings. The  petitioner craves  leave
     to refer  to  and  rely  upon  the  said
     photographs as and when produced.""
                          (emphasis supplied)
     Except  for   repeating  the   words  of   the  statute
prescribing the  corrupt practice,  there is  no pleading of
the  material   facts  or   any  particulars   necessary  to
constitute the corrupt practice as required by Section 83(1)
of the R.P. Act. Reference is made to certain photographs of
the alleged  wall paintings  and it  has been  said that the
photographs would  be relied  on as  and when  produced. The
contents or  form of the wall paintings or their photographs
has not been pleaded and the photographs referred in para 21
of  the  election  petition  were  neither  annexed  to  the
election petition nor copy thereof furnished to the returned
candidate along  with a copy of the petition. Thus, there is
no pleading  in the  election petition  of the  language  or
contents  of  the  wall  paintings  which  were  alleged  to
constitute the  corrupt practice  of canvassing for votes in
the name of Hindu religion.
     If the  mere mention  of photographs without indicating
its contents  in the election petition is to be construed as
incorporation of  its contents  by reference in the election
petition, then  non-supply of  the copy  of the  photographs
with the  copy of the election petition would result in non-
compliance of  Section 81(3). However, since the photographs
were not  annexed to the election petition, it is a case not
of non-compliance  of Section  81(3) but  a  case  of  total
absence of  any pleading  in the  election petition  of  the
corrupt practice  on the basis of wall paintings. Therefore,
the  pleading  being  wholly  deficient  in  material  facts
necessary  to   constitute  the  cause  of  action,  it  was
insufficient to  raise a  triable issue  on that  basis.  In
fact, this  part of the pleading was liable to be struck out
since it  was irrelevant at the trial for the reason stated.
It is  clear that any evidence adduced later, in the absence
of the  requisite pleading  of  this  corrupt  practice  was
irrelevant  and   inadmissible  and  should  not  have  been
recorded and  having been  recorded must  be  excluded  from
consideration. The  finding of the High Court of any corrupt
practice being  proved on this basis is contrary to law, and
has to be set aside for this reason alone.
     In view of the above conclusion in relation to the wall
paintings, any further discussion of the finding recorded by
Variava, J.  on this  question would  be unnecessary but for

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 11 of 14 
the serious  grievance made  to the mode of the trial. Since
the finding  reflects the common perception which influenced
the trial  and decision of the several election petitions in
the High  Court as  mentioned in  the impugned  judgment, it
becomes necessary  to refer  to the discussion on this point
in the impugned judgment.
     As indicated  earlier, no  triable issue  arose in  the
absence of proper pleadings relating to the corrupt practice
alleged on  the ground  of  wall  paintings,  much  less  an
occasion for  a finding adverse to the returned candidate on
this point.  Surprisingly,  evidence  was  recorded  of  the
alleged  contents   of  the   said  wall  paintings  through
production of  certain photographs  later at  the  trial.  A
description of what is seen in these photographs is given in
the impugned  judgment to  indicate  that  they  showed  the
saffron flag and election symbol of the Shiv Sena and sought
votes for the Shiv Sena candidates. The judgment then refers
to the  English translation  of the  slogans  therein  which
reads, as under :
          ""......   In order  to  remove  the
     brokers  of  corruption,  let  us  throw
     around the  Gulal of Hindutva""..... ""the
     lady sits  angrily in  Delhi Court, save
     Maharashtra by electing Sena-BJP"".......
     ""Our determination is firm. Stamp on the
     Bow and Arrow"" and ""Keep Hindutva awake,
     elect the  bow and  arrow."".......  ""for
     the protection  of  fiery  Hindutva  the
     Shiv Sena BJP candidate......""
     The judgement  then proceeds  to hold as
     under :
     ""......   There can be no doubt that the
     ""Hindutva"" in  these  wall-paintings  is
     the same  ""Hindutva""  contained  in  the
     video cassettes ""Awahan and Avhan"". They
     are therefore an appeal to vote for Shiv
     Sena BJP  candidates viz. The Respondent
     for protection of that ""Hindutva"". As is
     set out  hereafter an appeal in the name
     of ""Hindutva""  amounts to  an appeal  to
     vote for  the Hindu  candidates of  Shiv
     Sena BJP on the ground of their religion
     and also amounts to the corrupt practice
     or creating  enmity and  hatred  amongst
     different classes  of  citizens  on  the
     grounds of religion and community. These
     paintings   on   walls   and   pipelines
     therefore amount  to having  appealed to
     the voters to vote for the Respondent on
     the ground  of  his  religion  and  also
     amount  to   the  corrupt   practice  of
     creating  enmity   and  hatred   amongst
     different classes  of  citizens  on  the
     grounds of religion and community.""
Thereafter, the  discussion relates  to the  consent of  the
candidate which  is  unnecessary  in  view  of  the  earlier
conclusion.
     The tenor  of the  impugned judgment,  particularly the
above extract,  leaves no  doubt that  the High Court was of
the view  that any  appeal for  votes wherein  was  made  of
""Hindutva"" is  by itself  sufficient to  amount to an appeal
for votes  for the  Hindu candidates of Shiv Sena-BJP on the
ground of  their religion  and  is  a  corrupt  practice  or
creates enmity  and  hatred  amongst  different  classes  of
citizens on the grounds of religion and community. The above

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 12 of 14 
extract from  the decision  itself is sufficient to indicate
the erroneous  perception in  this behalf  which is  clearly
contrary to law. The distinction between sub-section (3) and
(3A)  of   Section  123  which  are  two  different  corrupt
practices, was  totally  lost  sight  of,  and  obliterated.
Moreover, the use of the word ""Hindutva"" in the abstract was
understood by  the High  Court to  amount to  an appeal  for
votes on  the ground  of Hindu  religion  if  the  candidate
happened to  be a  Hindu to  constitute the corrupt practice
under sub-section  (3); and  at the  same  time  this  alone
without anything  more has  been held to also constitute the
corrupt practice  under sub-section  (3A)  of  Section  123,
totally obliterating  the distinction between these two sub-
sections of  Section 123  constituting two different corrupt
practices. Unfortunately, this erroneous construction of the
statute leading  to the formation of a wrong perception, led
the High  Court to commit the several errors commencing with
the treating  of deficient  pleadings to  be  sufficient  to
raise  a   triable  issue   of  a   corrupt  practice.  This
extraordinary  procedure,   impermissible  in  law,  led  to
reception  of   considerable  irrelevant   and  inadmissible
evidence for  which no  basis can  be found  in the election
petition.
     In short,  the trial  of the election petition became a
roving inquiry  into the  affairs of  a political party when
the only  concern at the trial should have been the merit of
the charge  of corrupt  practices attributed to the returned
candidate  at  the  election.  Actions  of  the  party  were
relevant only  to  the  extent  relatable  to  the  returned
candidate, in  the manner  pleaded in the election petition.
Unfortunately, this  crucial factor  was overlooked  by  the
High Court in the trial of the election petition.
     In the  abstract, the meaning of the word ""Hindutva"" is
not confined  only to  Hindu religion  unrelated  to  Indian
culture and heritage and it is the context and the manner of
its use  which determines  its true  meaning in a particular
speech. The  kind of  use made  of the  word ""Hindutva"", the
context and  the composition  of the  audience to  which the
speech is  addressed, are  all significant. In the connected
Civil Appeal  No. 2453  of 1991  - Shri  Suryakant Venkatrao
Mahadik vs.  Smt. Saroj  Sandesh Naik  (Bhosale)  -  decided
today, we  have indicated how the use of the word ""Hindutva""
in the context and in the circumstances in which it was used
in that  case amounted  to an appeal for votes on the ground
of Hindu religion for a Hindu candidate. As a proposition of
law, it cannot be said that in the abstract, the mere use of
the  word   ""Hindutva""  during  an  election  campaign  must
necessarily mean  an appeal  on the ground of Hindu religion
for a  Hindu candidate.  We have  discussed this question at
some length in the connected Civil Appeal No. 2835 of 1989 -
Bal Thackeray  vs. Prabhakar K. Kunte and Ors. - (with Civil
Appeal No. 2836 of 1989) decided today. It is unnecessary to
reiterate the same herein.
     What is  forbidden by  law is  an appeal by a candidate
for votes  on the ground of ‘his’ religion or promotion etc.
of hatred  or enmity  between groups  of people, and not the
mere mention of religion. There can be no doubt that mention
made of  any religion  in the  context of  secularism or for
criticising the  anti-secular stance  of any political party
or candidate  cannot amount to a corrupt practice under sub-
section (3)  or (3A)  of Section 123. In other words it is a
question of  fact in  each case and not a proposition of law
as understood and enunciated by the High Court.
     The view  taken by  the  High  Court  in  the  impugned
judgment indicates  a  wrong  perception  based  on  a  mis-

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 13 of 14 
construction of  sub-sections (3)  and (3A)  of Section 123,
obliterating at  the same  time the  distinction in  the two
corrupt practices  defined  in  these  two  provisions.  The
finding of  the High  Court of proof of the corrupt practice
based on wall paintings in also, therefore, set aside.
Video Cassette
     The only  surviving question now relates to the corrupt
practice alleged  on the  basis of  certain video cassettes.
The pleading  is in paras 15 to 18 of the election petition.
There is  a general averment that the alliance had taken out
video cassettes for the purpose of its election campaign and
that  they   were  exhibited   at  various   places  in  the
constituency. It  is alleged  that the contents of the video
cassettes amounted  to appeal for votes in the name of Hindu
religion and they tended to create enmity and hatred amongst
the voters  on the  basis of  caste, creed and religion. The
only specific  fact pleaded apart from the general averment,
contained in para 18 is as under :-
          ""..... Bal  Thackeray also  boasted
     that if any one is obstructing the Hindu
     religion, he  will fix  him.  That  they
     (Shiv Sena)  will stop  all offering  of
     ""Namaz"" on  roads  and  bring  down  the
     loudspeakers  from   the  mosques.   Bal
     Thackeray has  gone  to  the  extent  of
     coaxing the  voters to scream aloud that
     they will  not tolerate  any one  coming
     into  power  with  the  help  of  Muslim
     votes.""
It is significant that here also the pleadings are deficient
and the  only averment  which may  be treated as specific is
the  above   extract  attributing   certain  speech  to  Bal
Thackeray of  which  also  no  particulars  are  given.  The
requisite pleading  of the  candidate’s consent for this act
of Bal  Thackeray to  constitute a  corrupt practice  by the
candidate (appellant)  is not pleaded apart from the general
pleading of consent elsewhere.
     This state  of pleading  relating  even  to  the  video
cassettes, when  the video  cassettes or its transcript were
not produced  along with  the election  petition or its copy
furnished with  the copy  of the  election petition  to  the
appellant, is  a serious  defect in  the pleading which once
again has  been totally  overlooked at  the  trial  of  this
election petition.  This again  has resulted  in raising  an
issue for  which the  requisite pleadings were not there and
then admitting considerable evidence which is irrelevant and
inadmissible. We  have considered this question at length in
the connected  Civil Appeal No. 4973 of 1993 - Manohar Joshi
vs. Nitin Bhaurao Patil & Anr. - decided today. For the same
reasons, the  entire issue  relating to the corrupt practice
based on  the  video  cassettes  has  to  be  excluded  from
consideration.
     Even otherwise  the only specific pleading on the point
which is  extracted above  is  insufficient  to  plead  this
corrupt   practice    against   the   appellant,   howsoever
reprehensible it  may be  in relation to the alleged conduct
of Bal  Thackeray. The  more fact  that  Bal  Thackeray  was
leader of  Shiv Sena  of which  party the  appellant  was  a
candidate is  by itself not sufficient to hold any candidate
guilty of  the corrupt  practice on the basis of an act done
by Bal  Thackeray unless  that liability  can be fastened on
the candidate  on further  proof that  the act was done with
the consent of the candidate or the display of that cassette
was made  with the candidate’s consent at the specified time
and place  etc. during  his  election  campaign.  All  these

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 14 of 14 
material facts  were required to be pleaded and proved, but,
instead, they  have been assumed and even the finding is not
related to any such specific act.
     The  requisite  consent  of  the  candidate  cannot  be
assumed merely  from the  fact that the candidate belongs to
the same  political party  of which  the wrong  doer  was  a
leader since  there can  be no presumption in law that there
is consent  of every  candidate of  the political  party for
every act  done by  every acknowledged leader of that party.
The corrupt  practice for  which a  candidate  can  be  held
vicariously guilty for an act of any other person who is not
his agent  in whose  favour general  authority is  presumed,
must be  pleaded and  proved to  be with  the consent of the
candidate.  Obviously,   it  is   so   because   the   penal
consequences  resulting   from  the  finding  of  a  corrupt
practice against  the candidate are visited on the candidate
including the  setting aside of his election. The High Court
assumed for the purpose of pleading as well as proof that no
specific pleading  or proof  of consent of the candidate was
necessary if  the act was attributed to any leader or even a
member of  the same political party. The distinction between
the ground  in  Section  100(1)(b)  on  which  the  election
petition was  allowed and  that under  Section 100(1)(d)(ii)
was completely  missed. Admittedly, the ground under Section
100(1)(d)(ii) is  neither the basis of the election petition
nor is it of the judgment of the High Court.
     It is  this erroneous  assumption made of the law as an
abstract proposition,  which has  resulted  in  the  several
serious errors  in the  trial as  well as  in  the  impugned
judgment. This  discussion is  sufficient to  set aside  the
only remaining finding against the appellant.
     From the above discussion, it follows that the findings
on  all   points  against  the  appellant,  of  the  corrupt
practices held  to be  proved against the appellant, have to
be set  aside, and  so  also  the  impugned  judgment  dated
5th/6th August, 1991, resulting in dismissal of the election
petition. The notices issued by the High Court under Section
99 of the R.P. Act to Chhagan Bhujbal, Bal Thackeray, Pramod
Mahajan, Manohar  Joshi and Pramod Navalkar after conclusion
of the trial must also be quashed for the above reasons.
     The result of this decision is that the inquiry against
Pramod Navalkar  and Manohar Joshi pending in the High Court
in this matter also terminates.
     The appeals are allowed. The appellant Ramakant Mayekar
would get  costs throughout  from the respondent Smt. Celine
D’Silva (election  petitioner). The  other parties will bear
their own costs throughout."

     Bahadurgarh was  declared as  an urban  estate  by  the
State Government  of Haryana in exercise of powers conferred
by section  3 of  the Punjab  Urban Estates  (Development  &
Regulation) Act,  1964 (hereinafter  ’the Punjab  Act’). The
declaration of  any area  to be  ’urban estate’, permits the
State  Government,   inter  alia,   to  sell  the  sites  in
accordance with  the Punjab  Urban Estates  (Sales of Sites)
Rules, 1965  (for short  ’the Punjab  Rules’). An  offer was
accordingly made  for free  hold sale of about 2200 plots on
first come  first serve  basis in Sector No.6 of the estate.
Applicants were  informed that  ""all modern  amenities  like
underground  sewerage,   storm   water,   drainage,   roads,
electricity, supply of potable water etc. will be provided"".
Pursuant to  this invitation,  a number  of persons  some of
whom are  the members  of appellant-Association, applied for
allotment. Appellant  No.2, Jeet  Ram, is one such applicant
and by  memo of  even  number  dated  9.8.1972,  the  Estate
Officer, Faridabad  informed Jeet Ram about the allotment of
residential Plot  No.852 to  him  on  terms  and  conditions
mentioned in  the memo.  (Similiar is the position qua other
allottees). We  are concerned  with condition  Nos.4  and  5
which read as below :
     ""4.  In case, you accept this allotment,
     you should  send the enclosed acceptance
     in the  form given at Annexure A to this
     letter together  with a  Bank draft  for
     Rs.750/- in order to make 29 per cent of

     In case  of failure  to deposit the said
     amount  within   the  above   sepecified
     period, the allotment shall be cancelled
     and the  deposit of  10 per cent Earnest

     5.   The  balance   of   80   per   cent
     tentative  price  can  be  paid  lumpsum
     without interest  within  60  days  from
     date of  issue of  this allotment letter
     or in  the  annual  equated  instalments
     with 7 per cent interest as laid down in
     Rule No.12  framed under  section  23(2)
     (b) (3)  (3) of the Punjab Urban Estates
     (Development and  Regulation) Act, 1964.
     The  first  instalment  shall  fall  due
     after the  expiry of  one year  from the
     date of issue of this allotment order"".
2.   As per  condition No.5  aforesaid, the first instalment
became due  on 9.8.1973,  that is,  after expiry of one year
from the  date of  issue of  the  allotment  order.  On  the
instalment not having been paid, respondent No.2, the Estate
Officer, sent  notices to  the  members  of  the  appellant-
Association to  pay the instalments including 7% interest on
the total  price of  the plot. Failing which, it was stated,
that action  under section  10 of  the Punjab  Act would  be
taken  which   visualises  resumption  and  forfeiture.  The
members of  the Association acted as required by the notices
but without  actually taking possession of the plots. It was
so because the plots had not been developed as visualised by
the    advertisement     seeking    applications.    Various
representations were  made  to  respondent  No.2  for  early
development and  for delivering the possession of the plots.
It was  also represented that the members of the Association
were being  charged  interest  without  actual  delivery  of
possession of  the plots  which according to the members was
not permissible.
3.   Despite the  aforesaid representations,  as  the  plots
were not developed, appellant No.2 approached the High Court
of Punjab  & Haryana  by  invoking  its  jurisdiction  under
Article 226  of the Constitution. The High Court has held in
the impugned  order that interest was chargeable. As regards
possession, the following observation was made in para 4 :
     ""4.  As regards  possession, it  may  be
     noticed   that    the   stand   of   the
     respondents  was   that  development  is
     still taking  place and  as soon  as the
     development is  completed, possession of
     the plot  would be offered to petitioner
     No.1. It  was further  stated at the bar
     that   in   case   the   petitioner   is
     interested in  taking possession  of the
     undeveloped  plot,  they  are  prepared.
     Counsel  for   the  petitioner  was  not
     prepared to accept this offer.""
Feeling aggrieved  at the  view taken by the High Court this
appeal has been preferred under Article 136.
4.   Shri  Bhandare,   learned  senior   counsel   for   the
appellants, has  strenuously contended that what was offered
for allotment  was developed plots and not undeveloped ones.
The follow  up submission is that as the plots are yet to be
developed fully,  the respondents  could  not  have  charged
interest because  possession of developed plots is yet to be

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 5 
given. The  stand of  the respondents  on the  other hand is
that charging  of interest is not co-related to the delivery
of possession,  as  is  in  case  of  allotments  under  the
provisions of  Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977
in view  of what  has been  mentioned in  Rule 5(7)  of  the
Haryana Urban  Development Authority  (Disposal of  Land and
Buildings)   Regulations,    1978,   (brevi   mani   Haryana
Regulations) provision  in which would not apply to the case
at hand in as much as the same is not the requirement of the
Punjab Rules.  Ms. Nisha,  appearing  for  the  respondents,
submitted that  as per  Rule  12(2)  of  the  Punjab  Rules,
interest accrues from the date of the issue of the allotment
order as has been mentioned in the aforesaid condition No.5.
5.   The allotment  in the  present  case  being  under  the
Punjab Rules,  we are  satisfied that  the provisions of the
Haryana Regulations  cannot be  called  in  aid  and  it  is
because of  this that  terms and conditions mentioned in the
allotment order  of other  persons, an  instance of which is
the allotment  to  one  Surat  Singh  by  memo  No.23  dated
28.2.1979, can  be of  no assistance to the appellants. Shri
Bhandare’s alternative  submission is  that in  any case  as
possession of  developed  plots  has  yet  not  been  given,
interest  cannot   be  demanded,  even  as  per  the  scheme
visualised by the Punjab Rules. A perusal of the Rules shows
that after  applications are made for allotment and the same
are accepted,  possession of  the site  is  required  to  be
delivered to  the transferee,  as mentioned in Rule 7, after
he has paid 25% of the price. Another provision of the Rules
which is  required to  be noted  is that  the transferee  is
required to  complete the  building within  three years from
the date  of issue of allotment order as per Rule 14, though
this time limit may be extended by the Estate Officer, if he
is satisfied  that the  failure  to  complete  the  building
within the  period of  three years  was due to causes beyond
the control of the transferee.
6.   We are  thus satisfied  that if the Rules are read as a
whole, possession  of the  allotted plot  is required  to be
given within  reasonable time  after payment  of 25%  of the
price. Rule  14 itself would indicate that possession has to
be delivered  soon after  the allotment  order to enable the
transferee to  complete the building within three years from
the date  of issue of allotment order. The submission of Ms.
Nisha is  that Rule  14 having  visualised extension  of the
time  limit,   this  Rule  would  not  require  delivery  of
possession soon  after the  payment of the 25% of the price.
According to  us, this submission cannot be accepted because
the power of extension given to the Estate Officer is really
meant to  be exercised when the transferee, after receipt of
possession of the land, is not in a position to complete the
building.  We,  therefore,  hold  that  interest  cannot  be
demanded till  offer of  possession is  made.  There  is  no
dispute that appellant No.2 had paid the required amount. It
is also  not in  dispute that the possession of the plot was
not delivered within reasonable time thereafter.
7.   Shri Bhandare  has taken  pains to  persuade us to hold
that it  is incumbent  on the  part of the Estate Officer to
deliver possession  of developed  plots and  as even by 1985
such plots  had not  been offered  for  delivery,  as  would
appear from  the  order  passed  by  this  Court  itself  on
14.1.1985,  there  can  be  no  justification  in  demanding
payment of  interest.  As  per  the  learned  counsel,  full
development  is  yet  to  take  place  in  as  much  as  the
statements made  by the respondents in their application for
vacation of stay, which was registered as I.A. No.2 of 1992,
were as below :

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 5 
     ""1. that  the Sector-6,  Bahadurgarh  is
     almost fully developed.
     2) That  150 houses  are constructed for
     which the  completion certificates  have
     been issued.
     3) That  near about 250 houses are under
     construction.
     4) That water supply work is completed.
     5) That road works in the sector is also
     completed.
     6)  That   the  internal  sewerage  line
     S.W.D. (Storm  Water drainage) have been
     laid down  and  temporary  disposal  has
     been completed.""
     Ms. Nisha,  however, states  that this  position was in
1992; by  now, she  has instruction  to stay that plots have
been fully developed.
8.   To decide  the aforesaid submission of Shri Bhandare we
would really be required to find out as to whether the offer
was of  developed plots  or undeveloped  plots. As the offer
had stated  that  modern  amenities  noted  above  ""will  be
provided"", it  cannot be  held that  till the  amenities  as
mentioned  have   become  fully  functional,  the  offer  is
incomplete. It  is for  this reason  that the fact that full
development has  not yet  taken place,  even if  that be the
position as  contended by  Shri Bhandare, cannot be a ground
to hold  that interest  has not  become payable.  It is true
that the  applicants  were  given  to  understand  that  the
amenities noted  above would  become available  (and  within
reasonable time),  the fact  that the  same did  not  become
available to the desired extent could not be a ground not to
accept delivery  of possession.  From the  order of the High
Court which  we have quoted above, we find that the offer of
possession of  the undeveloped  plot was not accepted by the
counsel of  the appellant. That order being of 17th October,
1980, we  are of  the view  that interest did become payable
from that  date. The  fact that  plot has not yet been fully
developed, as  is the case of the appellant, has, therefore,
no significance  in  so  far  as  charging  of  interest  is
concerned. We are not in a position to accept the submission
of Shri  Bhandare that  equity would  not demand charging of
interest,  even  though  the  plots  are  yet  to  be  fully
developed. When  parties enter  into contract,  they are  to
abide by  the terms  and conditions  of the same, unless the
same be inequitable. In the present case, question of equity
does not  really arise  in as much as the condition relating
to interest  is founded  on a statutory rule, vires of which
has not  been challenged.  The provision  in a  cognate rule
cannot alter  the consequence  which has  to follow from the
rule which holds the field. In the present case it being the
Punjab Rules  under which the allotment was made, we are not
in a  position to  agree with  Shri  Bhandare,  despite  his
forceful submission, that the appellants may not be asked to
pay interest, despite their having been no offer of delivery
of possession of fully developed plots.
9.   We, therefore,  hold that  the interest  in the present
and similar cases had become due from 17th October, 1980. We
understand from  Shri Bhandare  that most  of the members of
the appellant-Association  had  paid  the  instalments  with
interest as per the notice of the respondent No.2. According
to us,  as interest  became chargeable  from  17th  October,
1980, it  would be open to the members of the Association to
claim refund  if they  had paid  interest, as claimed in the
notices issued by the respondent No.2.
10.  We do  not propose  to leave  the matter  at this.  The

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 5 of 5 
allotments having been made about two decades ago, there can
be no  justification in  not fully developing the plots even
by 1992.  The statement in I.A. No.2 of 1992 that the sector
is ""almost fully developed"" and that ""temporary disposal has
been completed""  do speak  about lack of proper interest and
attention on the part of the respondents. In this connection
we would  state that  a statement had been made on behalf of
the  respondents   before  this   Court  on  14.1.1985  that
possession of  the developed  plots would  be given  to  the
appellants within  a period  of six  months, and  so such  a
direction was  given. Shri Bhandare states that direction is
yet to  be complied  with in  letter and  spirit. It is this
complaint which has given rise to Contempt Petition No.22 of
1989. On  the facts and circumstances of the case, we do not
propose to  pursue the contempt application and would direct
the respondents  once again to develop the sector fully, and
not, ""almost  fully"". This  would be done within a period of
six months,  failing which the respondents would not only be
liable for  contempt but  the allottees  would be exonerated
from the liability to pay any interest whatsoever.
11.  The appeal  is disposed  of  accordingly,  without  any
order as to costs."

     Substitution allowed.
     This Court while disposing of the matter by order dated
July 20,  1988 directed  that depending upon the decision of
the Constitution  Bench in Union of India vs. Raghubir Singh
[(1989) 3 SCR 316], the payment of the interest and solatium
would be  determined. Since there the Constitution Bench had
concluded that  the  claimants  would  be  entitled  to  the
statutory benefits  under Amendments  Act 60  of 1984 if the
proceedings are  pending before the Land Acquisition Officer
or Civil  Court between  April  30,  1984,  i.e.,  when  the
Amendment Act  68 of 1984 was introduced on the floor of the
Parliament and  the date  when the  Act came  into force  in
September 24, 1984. Admittedly, the award came to be made on
August 30,  1982 and  the supplementary award with regard to
the trees etc., came to be made on December 27, 1982.
     Under these  circumstances, the  petitioners  would  be
entitled to  payment of  solatium under Section 23 [2] @ 30%
per annum  on enhanced  compensation. As regards the payment
of interest  under Section  28 of  the Land  Acquisition At,
1894 and  the additional  amount under  Section 23  [1-A] of
that Act, admittedly, the petitioners remained in possession
of the  acquired land.  Under Sections  34, 28  and 23 [1-A]
payment of  interest and  additional amount  was intended to
mitigate the  hardship caused to the owner by deprivation of
enjoyment of  their property,  after possession  was  taken.
Since the  possession was  admittedly with  the petitioners,
they are  not entitled  to payment of interest under Section
34, 28  or additional  amount  under  Section  23  [1-A]  as
amended by Act 68 of 1984.
     The Land  Acquisition Officer will determine the amount
of solatium  payable to  the petitioners  within a period of
four weeks  from the  date of  the receipt of this order and
within six  weeks thereafter  the amount so determined would
be paid  to the  petitioners. Before making the payment, the
petitioners shall  hand over  the  possession  to  the  Land
Acquisition Officer.
     The petitions are ordered accordingly. No costs.

     Since the  first respondent  now  stands  retired  from
service, no  useful purpose  will be  served to continue the
proceedings pursuant  to the  show cause  notice  which  was
quashed by  the High  Court. No doubt the High Court was not
justified in  exercising its  power to nip the action in the
bud at the notice stage itself. As regards the law, recently
this Court  has considered  the controversy and laid the law
in Kumari  Madhuri Patil vs. Additional Commissioner [(1994)
6 SCC  241] and  Director of  Tribal Welfare,  Government of
A.P. vs.  Laveti Giri & Anr. [JT 1995 (3) SC 684]. The ratio
of the High Court decision is no longer good law.
     Under these  circumstances, we  think  that  no  useful
purpose will be served to continue the proceedings. However,
if the children of the first respondent lay any claim on the
basis that  they are  Scheduled Tribes,  it would be open to
the appropriate  authorities to take appropriate decision or
action as is warranted under law.
     The appeal is disposed of with the above observations."

M.K. MUKHERJEE. J.
     The seven  appellants in  these appeals and one Mahadev
Prasad Pandey  were  placed  on  trial  before  the  learned
Additional Sossions  Judge, Mathura.  Against the appellants
common charges  under Sections  120-B. 148, 302/149. and 454
I.P.C. and  against  Mahadev  Prasad  Pandey  charges  under
Sections 302/109  and 307/109  IPC were  framed. A  separate
charge under  Section 302  IPC was  also framed  against the
appellant Anokhey  Lal.  On  conclusion  of  the  trial  the
learned Judge.  while acouitting  Mahadev Prasad,  convicted
all the  appellants under  Sections 148  and 324/149 IPC and
further convicted  Anokhey Lal  under Section  302 IPC.  For
each of  their convictions  the appellants were sentenced to
suffer rigorous  imprisonment for  two years and Anokhey Lal
was sentenced  to imprisonment  for life  for his conviction
under Section  302 IPC.  The sentences  were directed to run
concurrently. Against  the above  judgment two  appeals were
filed; one by the appellants assailing their convictions and
the other  by the State against their acquittal of the other
charges. The  High Court  dismissed  both  the  appeals  and
affirmed  the  judgment  of  the  High  Court.  Hence  these
appeals.
     According to  the prosecution case on March 27, 1975 at
or  about  6.30  A.M.  the  appellants.  armed  with  deadly
weapons, raided the house of Gopal and appellant Anokhey Lal
thrust a  spear on  the chest  of Makhan,  brother of Gopal,
felling him  down. On  hearing the  hue and  cry  raised  by
Makhan, Ram Dayal, Gopal and Ram Krishan came there and they
were also  attacked by  the appellants  by their  respective
weapons. Finding  no other  alternative. when  Gopal started
thowing brick-bats  towards the appellants and Ram Dayal and
Ram Krishan started beating them with small dandas they fled
away.
     Makhan, who  was seriously injured, was taken to police
station along  with the  other injured by Giriraj. his elder

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 3 
brother. and there he (Giriraj) gave a written report of the
incident, on  the basis  of  which  a  case  was  registered
against the  appellants. Since  the condition  of Makhan was
grave he  was immediately sent to Mathura Hospital while the
other injured  were sent  to  local  Government  dispensary.
Makhan, however,  did not  respond to  the medical treatment
given to  him at  the hospital and succumbed to his injuries
within an hour.
     The  appellants  pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charges
levelled against  them and  took up  the plea  of  right  of
private defence of their persons.
     To prove  its case  the prosecution  examined a host of
witnesses of  whom Giriraj  (P.W.1).  Ram  Krishan  (P.W.2),
Rameshwar Prasad  (P.W.3), Puran  Devi (P.W.4) and Ram Dayal
(P.W.5)  gave  the  ocular  version  of  the  incident.  The
appellants also examined a number of witnesses in support of
their defence.
     On consideration  of evidence  adduced during trial the
trial  Court   accepted  the  case  of  the  prosecution  in
preference to  that of  the defence  and held the appellants
guilty. The  High Court  also in  its turn.  reappraised the
evidence and upheld the order of the trial Court.
     Having heard  the learned  counsel  appearing  for  the
parties and  considered the  judgments of the learned Courts
below in  the light  of the evidence adduced during trial we
do not  find any reason whatsoever to disturb the concurrent
findings of  fact recorded  by them,  more so,  as they  are
based on  detailed  and  proper  discussion  of  the  entire
evidence and supported by cogent reasons.
     It was,  however,  strongly  urged  on  behalf  of  the
appellants that  even if  the entire  prosecution  case  was
accepted as  true Anokhey Lal could only be, in view of fact
that Makhan  sustained only one injury, guilty of an offence
under Section  304 (Part  II) IPC  and not under Section 302
IPC.
     As already  noticed the  prosecution case  was that the
appellant Anokhey  lal had  thrust a  spear on  the chest of
Makhan. Dr.  Jagdish Lal  (P.W.  13)  who  held  post-mortem
examination on  the dead  body of Makhan found the following
injury on his person:
     ""Incised would  1 1/2""  x 1/2""  x  chest
     cavity deep  of linear  nature near  the
     sternum bone on the front side below the
     chest.""
     He further stated that on internal examination he found
the pericardium  damaged and  one ounce  of  blood  present.
According  to  P.W.13  the  injury  was  sufficient  in  the
ordinary course  of nature to cause death of Makhan and that
the same could be caused by a spear.
     When considered in the context of the proved facts that
the appellants had gone armed with deadly weapons, to attack
the members of Gopal’s family and after trespassing into the
house Anokhey  Lal caused  a penetrating  injury on  a vital
part of the body of Makhan with a spear which was sufficient
in the  ordinary  course  of  nature  to  cause  death,  the
conclusion is  inevitable  that  the  offence  committed  by
Anokhey Lal comes within clause III of Section 300 IPC so as
to make  Anokhey Lal liable for conviction under Section 302
IPC. As  regards the other six appellants, whose convictions
are to  be upheld,  we do  not feel  inclined to  send  them
behind the  bars again as more than twenty years have elapsd
since the  offences were  committed by them and each of them
has served a substantial part of their sentence of two years
rigorous imprisonment.
     For the  foregoing discussion we uphold the convictions

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 3 
and sentence  recorded against the appellant Anokhey lal and
the convictions  of the  other six  appellants put we reduce
their sentence  to the  period already undergone. As all the
appellants are  on bail.  Anokhey Lal  will now surrender to
his bail  bond to  serve out  the sentence imposed upon him,
while the  other six  appellants will  stand discharged from
their respective  bail bonds.  The appeals are thus disposed
of.
     Since the  appeals have  been disposed of Special Leave
Petition filed  by the complainant and the other injured and
the Crl. M.P. No. 2949 of 1994 filed in connection therewith
are dismissed."

JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     This appeal  is directed  against the  judgment of  the
Central Administrative  Tribunal, Allahabad  (the  tribunal)
dated July  18, 1990 upholding the order of the president of
India under  Rule 9  of the  Central Civil Service (Pension)
Rules, 1972  (the  Pension  Rules)  withholding  the  entire
monthly pension admissible to the appellant and also denying
the death-cum-retirement gratuity to which the appellant may
be entitled under the rules.
     The appellant, Sita Ram Yadava, was working as a Sorter
in the  Railway Mail  Service at  Kanpur. He was absent from
duty from  October 11,  1973 to  July 30, 1974. In the night
between October  20/21, 1973,  70 gms  of illicit  opium was
recovered from  Sita Ram Yadava who at that time stated that
he was  the son  of Bhagwati  Prasad. He was arrested by the
Excise Inspector  under the  Opium  Act.  According  to  the
respondents the  arrested person  was none  other  than  the
appellant who  according to  the railway  record is  son  of
Jhullan Prasad.  Sita Ram Yadava was convicted under Section
9 of  the Opium  Act and  was sentenced  to undergo rigorous
imprisonment for  three months.  Appeal  filed  by  him  was
dismissed by  the Sessions Judge. Criminal Revision filed by
Yadava was  dismissed by  the Jabalpur  Bench of  the  Madha
Pradesh High Court on February 28, 1975.
     Disciplinary proceedings  were  initiated  against  the
appellant and as a consequence he was dismissed from service
by the order dated December 21, 1974 under Rule 19(i) of the
Central Civil  Services (Classification, Control and Appeal)
Rules, 1965  (the Rules).  The  appellant  preferred  appeal
which was  allowed with  a  direction  to  the  disciplinary
authority to  hold an  inquiry under  Rule 19  of the Rules.
Since the  case of  the appellant  before  the  disciplinary
authority was  that Sita  Ram Yadava who was convicted under
the Opium Act was a different person than the appellant, the
appellate authority  further directed  that the disciplinary

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 4 
authority should  properly investigate  into the identity of
the petitioner/convict  and thereafter  pass final  order in
the matter.  The disciplinary  authority as  a result of the
inquiry passed  the order dated June 11, 1984 dismissing the
appellant from  service. A  finding was  recorded  that  the
appellant was  the same person who had been convicted by the
criminal court under the Opium Act.
     The appellant  preferred appeal against the order dated
June 11, 1984 and once again the appellate authority allowed
the appeal  and directed  the disciplinary authority to give
further hearing  to the appellant. It was also directed that
opportunity to  cross-examine the hand-writing expert should
also be  given. Before  the departmental  inquiry  could  be
completed, the  appellant retired  from service on March 31,
1985. The  inquiry was, thereafter, converted into one under
the  Pension   Rules.  The  disciplinary  authority  finally
recorded the  finding that  it was  the  appellant  who  was
convicted  under   the  Opium   Act.  The  proceedings  were
forwarded to  the President  of India  for final orders. The
President proposed the provisional punishment of withholding
the petitioner’s  pension  permanently  and  not  disbursing
death-cum-retirement gratuity  to him.  Accordingly, a  show
cause notice  dated  August  23,  1985  was  issued  to  the
appellant and  he submitted  his  reply.  The  Union  public
Service Commission was consulted which approved the proposed
punishment.  Finally  the  President  passed  the  order  of
punishment on May 5, 1987.
     The Tribunal in the impugned judgment held as under:-
     ""We do  not think, therefore, that there
     is any  doubt in the authenticity of the
     court papers  whose negatives  were made
     over  to  its  Expert.  So  far  as  the
     photographs from  the Service  Book  and
     taking of  specimen signatures and thumb
     impressions by  the  Expert  himself  on
     19.1.1984  is  concerned,  there  is  no
     reason to  doubt their  genuineness. All
     these papers, according to the report of
     the  Expert,   were  obtained  from  the
     office of  the Senior  Superintendent of
     Post Offices/the disciplinary authority.
     The  papers,   therefore,  came  from  a
     proper custody  ...........There  is  no
     reason,  therefore,  to  hold  that  the
     materials which  were  examined  by  the
     Expert were  not reliable or appropriate
     materials   for    the    purposes    of
     determining   the    identity   of   the
     petitioner  with   the  convict  of  the
     criminal case.""
     In the  penultimate para  of the  judgment the Tribunal
finally observed as under:
     ""These are  all the  points  which  have
     arisen in  this case. We notice that not
     only the  disciplinary authority appears
     to  have  considered  all  the  relevant
     materials,  but   the  case   was   also
     considered by  the Union  Public Service
     Commission,    who    submitted    their
     recommendations     dated      19.3.1987
     (Annexure-14).   A   perusal   of   this
     document  shows   that  the   Commission
     considered at  length  the  disciplinary
     proceedings  including   the   appellate
     order requiring  the investigation to be

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 4 
     made to  fix the  petitioner’s identity.
     After  the  Inquiring  officer’s  report
     dated 25.9.1985, the reply dated 13-9-85
     given by  the  petitioner  is  also  the
     Commission. In  para 5 of Annexure-14 it
     is  said   that  the   Commission   have
     examined  the   records  of   the   case
     carefully and  saw no  reason to  differ
     from  the   findings  of  the  Inquiring
     Officer arrived  at on  the basis of the
     totality of the evidence examined during
     during the  enquiry  and  confirmed  the
     view of  the Inquiring  Officer that the
     petitioner is  the same  person, who was
     convicted   in    the   criminal   case.
     Apparently the  Commission has  bestowed
     its attention  to the  controversy it is
     not a case of non-application of mind.""
     We see no ground to interfere with the findings of fact
reached by  the departmental  authorities and  upheld by the
Tribunal. We  agree with  the reasoning  and the conclusions
reached by the Tribunal.
     This Court,  while granting  special leave,  passed the
following order :
     ""Special   leave    granted.   By    the
     Presidential order  dated 5.5.1987, both
     pension and  DCRG  have  been  withheld.
     Counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted
     that so  far as  gratuity is  concerned,
     the  matter   stands  covered   by  this
     Court’s decision  in D.V. Kapur V. Union
     of India,  1990 (4)  SCC 314.  That case
     turned on  the interpretation  of Rule 9
     of the  Civil  Services  Conduct  Rules,
     1972. In  paragraph 10  of the  judgment
     after referring  to the Rule, this Court
     pointed out  that the  right to gratuity
     being a  statutory right  could be taken
     away by a valid Rule only and since Rule
     9 did  not empower  the  withholding  of
     gratuity and  no other  rule was pointed
     out which  permitted the  withholding of
     gratuity, the order withholding gratuity
     could not  be sustained.  We enquired of
     Mr. Tulsi,  learned ASG,  if he was in a
     position to  point out  any  Rule  which
     entitled the President to withhold DCRG.
     He was not able to do so. It, therefore,
     prima facie  appears that the contention
     urged by  counsel in  regard to gratuity
     is well founded.
     We, therefore,  by  this  interim  order
     direct  the   release  of  DCRG  to  the
     petitioner on  the petitioner  giving an
     undertaking to  this Court to refund the
     same  in   the  event   this  Court   so
     directs.""
     It is  not necessary  for us  to go  into the  question
whether death-cum-retirement, gratuity can be withheld under
the Pension  Rules. Since the said gratuity has already been
paid to  the appellant,  we are of the view that it would be
in the interest of justice to permit the appellant to retain
the same. He shall, however, not be entitled to the pension.
     The appeal is disposed of accordingly. No costs.

JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     Leave granted.
     This appeal  by special  leave arises from the judgment
dated November  10, 1993  of the  Division Bench of the High
Court passed in D.B. Spl. Appeal No.607 of 1991.
     The facts  are not  in dispute. The first respondent is
an educational  institution which  made  a  request  to  the
appellant for  allotment of  15,000 sq.  yards  of  land  in
Malviya Nagar  Scheme. By proceedings dated August 12, 1988,
the appellant had informed the respondents that it had fixed
the reserved  price at  Rs.160/- per  sq. meter for schools.
Clause 5  says that  the lease money can be changed after 15
years but  it will  not exceed  25% of  the reserved  price.
Clause 15  of the offer envisages that on non-payment of the
demanded amount  within one  month, the  appellant  will  be
entitled to  realize interest  and cancel  the allotment. In
case of  acceptance, Clause 16 sub-clause [ii] provides that
""if you accept the allotment of the above conditions, please
deposit the  amount within  one month as under"". The details
of the amount have been mentioned and the total amount to be
deposited was  Rs.20,31,820.90. Admittedly,  the respondents
had deposited  only one  lakh. Thereafter,  the Secretary to
the appellant  had communicated  through a  letter that  the
State Government had granted permission for allotment of the
land at  25% of the reserved price to the respondent-Academy
by letter  dated August 12, 1988 and that is being returned.
Then on  January 12,  1990, pursuant  to a letter written by
the respondents  on July  6, 1989, they also reiterated that
they were  willing to  allot the  land @  25%  of  the  then
prevailing  reserved  price  of  the  land  and  the  amount
mentioned thereunder  has been specified. It was also stated
expressly thus:
          ""Please see  that the  cost of  the
     land  is  deposited  in  favour  of  the
     Secretary,  J.D.A.,  Jaipur,  within  30

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 3 
     days from  the date  of  issue  of  this
     letter failing  which the  offer  stands
     cancelled.""
     The  allotment   order  dated   August  12,   1988  was
thereafter cancelled.  Thus  the  previous  allotment  stood
cancelled  and   fresh  offer   was  made   subject  to  the
respondents depositing  the amount  stated thereunder within
30 days  from the  date of  issue of the letter. Admittedly,
the amount  was not  deposited, except writing a letter that
the Rajasthan  Urban Improvement  Trust [Disposal  of  Urban
Land] Rules,  1974  envisage  that  50%  of  the  prevailing
reserved price was to be paid and the appellant’s demand was
illegal.
          Rule which  has  been  relied  upon
     reads thus:
          ""No land  shall be  allotted for  a
     price less  than the sanctioned reserved
     price  except   for  categories  covered
     under Rule 17.""
     Rule 17 provides as under:
          ""Lands for schools and other public
     and  charitable   institutions  may   be
     allotted  on   payment  of  50%  of  the
     sanctioned reserved  price or  with  the
     prior permission of the State Government
     free of  any charge  or at  concessional
     rates.""
     It would thus be seen that it may be incumbent upon the
appellant to  allot the  land but  in case  they  choose  to
allot, they  may allot  on payment  of 50% of the sanctioned
reserved price.  It would  be seen  that in the first offer,
the appellant  had offered  land @ Rs.160/- per sq. meter as
reserved price and the respondents had not complied with the
same. As stated earlier, the offer stood cancelled. In 1990,
when a  second offer  was made,  even then  also, it was not
complied with. The respondents have relied upon the circular
issued  by  the  Government  amplifying  as  to  under  what
circumstances allotment  may be  made at a lesser price. The
circular dated  October 13,  1987  is  only  guidelines  for
disposal of the lands for educational, religious, charitable
or public  institutions at  concessional rate  of 25% as the
reserved  price,   but  the   instructions  were  to  ensure
uniformity in  the allotment  and charging  the  rates.  The
offer had  been given  charging @  Rs.160/- per sq. meter in
the first  instance and  the respondents  had not  paid  the
amount except  Rs.1  lakh.  Had  they  paid  the  amount  at
reserved price and claimed refund at 50% or 25%, as the case
may, as per their own case, something could be said in their
favour. But  unfortunately they  did not  accept  the  offer
which was  conditional. They had chosen to deposit only Rs.1
lakh  as   against  Rs.21  lakhs.  As  stated  earlier,  the
cancellation order  was not  challenged. When  a fresh offer
was made then also the respondents had not complied with the
offer; instead  they went  to the  court for  a direction to
give them  allotment at concessional rate of 25% of original
value at  Rs.160 per  sq. meter. The Division Bench had thus
erroneously directed  the allotment  on payment  of  25%  of
Rs.160/- per sq. yard, which offer was no longer subsisting,
since it  was already  cancelled. Under these circumstances,
the order of the High Court is clearly illegal.
     The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The  writ petition
stands dismissed. No costs.

JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     This  appeal   by  special  leave  arises  against  the
judgment and decree dated August 4, 1981 of the Gauhati High
Court at  Guwahati made  in S.A.  No. 17/76. The appellants-
plaintiffs filed  the suit for declaration of title that the
lands in Chaibari Village which were part of Machpara Estate
were given  to  Dayamoyee  Devi,  daughter  of  Rai  Bahadur
Prithiram Chowdhury,  the holder of the said estate as dowry
at the  time of her marriage and that she and thereafter her
successors including  the plaintiffs  had been in possession
and enjoyment  of the  lands in  their own  right. The lands
therein did not stand vested in the State of Assam under the
Assam State  Acquisition of  the Zamindaries  Act, 1951. The
trial court  decreed the  suit. But  on appeal, the District
Judge reversed  the decree  and held that the appellants had
failed to  prove that  the appellants possessed the lands in
their own  right and  that it  was not  vested in the State.
Accordingly, the suit was dismissed. In second appeal, while
upholding the  findings of  the appellate Court, the learned
Single Judge of the High Court held that if the compensation
for the lands comprised in Chaibari Village were not paid, a
conditional decree was passed directing the State to pay the
compensation in respect thereof to the appellants. Thus this
appeal by special leave.
     Shri S.K.  Nandy, learned  counsel for  the appellants,
has contended  that since  the lands  had passed on from the
Zamindar to  his daughter  as dowry, she became the absolute
owner of  the property.  The State  had not proved that they
had acquired  the land  under the  Act and that compensation
was paid  to them.  Thereby the  lands did  not vest  in the
State. The  High Court,  therefore, was not right in holding
that the title of the land in favour of the appellants stood
extinguished  under  the  Act.  We  find  no  force  in  the
contention.
     The High  Court has  gone into  the question of adverse
possession pleaded  by the  appellants  and  held  that  the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
adverse possession is an encumbrance under the State Revenue
Act and  it does  not bind  the State. Therefore, as against
the State,  the appellant  had not  perfected her  title  by
adverse  possession.   It  was  also  held  that  since  the
appellants had  asserted title to the property, burden is on
the appellants  to establish  that they  had  title  to  the
plaint schedule  lands and  continued to have title thereto.
Since they  failed to  establish the  title, the  appellants
cannot be  held to  be the  owners of  the land.  High Court
called upon the Government to produce certain notifications.
Since they  were not  produced, the High Court had expressed
its  displeasure  for  the  lethargy  on  the  part  of  the
officials of the Government but that was not conclusive. The
ultimate finding is that the appellants had not proved their
title to  the lands  and they  did  not  form  part  of  the
acquisition under  the Act. They did not remain as owners of
the lands  and the  lands stood  vested in  the State. These
conclusions reached  by the  High Court  are not vitiated by
any manifest error of law warranting interference.
     However, the High Court had granted conditional decree,
namely, the  payment of  the compensation,  if  not  already
paid. It  is, therefore,  for  the  appellants  to  make  an
application to the appropriate authority seeking payment, if
not already  received, and  the  competent  authority  would
consider and  dispose of the matter within three months from
the  date   of  making   the  application   for  payment  of
compensation, if not already paid. The appeal is disposed of
in above terms. No costs."

     Leave granted.
     Only  controversy   is  whether   the  first  appellant
fulfilled the qualifications of 12th standard prescribed for
consideration of  her  membership  of  the  Stock  Exchange.
Admittedly, the  appellant passed Matric which is equivalent
to 11th  standard in  Gujarat State,  Saurashtra region. The
Saurashtra University Act, 1965 (Gujarat Act 39 of 1965) was
amended by  the Gujarat Secondary Education (Amendment) Act,
1978, (Gujarat Act No. 32 of 1978) which was published after
receipt of  the assent  of the  President  in  the  ""Gujarat
Government Gazette"" on the 29th September, 1978. It provided
that in  Section 43  clause (i)  after the  words ""Secondary
School Certificate  Examination"" the  words ""in the eleventh
standard  or   the  Higher   Secondary  School   Certificate
Examination"" shall  be inserted.  The Explanation  there  to
clearly  amplifies   that  the   ""Higher  Secondary   School
Certificate  Examination""   means  the  examination  of  the
students in the twelfth standard. The first appellant having
passed the  eleventh standard examination was thus qualified
for consideration  of membership  of the Stock Exchange. The
Screening Committee  had rejected her petition on the ground
that the  first appellant  had not have the qualification of
12th standard  in that  behalf; it was, however, not brought
to  its   notice  that   by  virtue  of  the  aforementioned
amendment, the  eleventh standard  was  made  equivalent  to
Higher Secondary Certificate Examination.
     In view  of the legal position set out above, the first
appellant is  entitled to  be considered  by the appropriate
Committee whether  she could  be admitted  a member  of  the
Saurashtra-Kutch Stock  Exchange at  Rajkot. The  appeal  is
accordingly allowed.  The Screening Committee would consider
and dispose  of the  claim of  the first  appellant within a
period of  eight weeks  from the date of the receipt of this
order. No costs.

     Leave granted.
     These appeals  by special  leave are  by the  State  of
Assam and arise out of unusual circumstances involving three
senior officers  of the  Government of  Assam,  namely,  the
Chief Secretary  H.N. Das,  Additional Chief  Secretary P.C.
Mishra and  Commissioner (Home)  C.K. Das.  At  the  hearing
before us Shri Kapil Sibal, learned counsel for the State of
Assam submitted that it was agreed by all concerned that the
adverse remarks  made by  the Tribunal in the impugned order
against Shri H.N. Das should be expunged and, therefore, the
State Government does not press these appeals on merits even
though it  does not accept the correctness of the Tribunal’s
order. All  the other  counsel appearing  for the  different
parties in  these appeals  supported the  submission of Shri
sibal and  a common  prayer was  made to  dispose  of  these
appeals in these terms.
     Ordinarily, in  view of  the common  stand taken at the
hearing of  these appeals  it may not have been necessary to
say anything more. However, in view of the distressing facts
and circumstances which have given rise to these appeals, we
consider it  necessary to  state briefly  the relevant facts
and express  out views  which we consider expedient with the
hope that it prevents such situations in future at any level
of the administration, mush less at the highest level.

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN

Page 2 of 4 
     Shri P.C.  Mishra was  posted as  the Chairman  of  the
Assam Board  of Revenue  at the relevant time. By the orders
dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992 of the Department of Personnel
(A) in  the Government  of Assam,  the  displeasure  of  the
Government was  conveyed to  Shri P.C.  Mishra for  conduct.
Shri P.C.  Mishra filed O.A. No.211 of 1992 for quashing the
said orders  and the  O.A. has  been allowed by the impugned
order dated  1/8/1994 quashing  the orders  dated 10/10/1991
and 8/9/1992  made by  the Government of Assam. While making
this order,  the Tribunal  has made  certain adverse remarks
against Shri  H.N. Das,  who was then the Chief Secretary of
the State.  These appeals  by special leave are by the State
Government against the Tribunal’s order.
     As earlier  stated, these  appeals are  not pressed  on
merits  and,   therefore,  the   State  Government’s  orders
conveying displeasure  against Shri  P.C. Mishra having been
quashed, no  grievance survives  to Shri P.C. Mishra. In the
process of  quashing the Government orders against Shri P.C.
Mishra,  the  Tribunal  has  made  certain  adverse  remarks
against Sh.  H.N. Das which, it is common ground, now should
be expunged. On the expunging of the adverse remarks against
Shri P.C.  Mishra would  survive without the adverse remarks
against Shri H.N. Das.
     The material  facts giving  rise  to  this  unfortunate
situation are  a few. In November 1990 Shri H.N. Das was the
Chief Secretary  of the  State and  Shri P.C. Mishra was the
only officer  in the  rank of  Additional Chief Secretary of
the State.  On 8/11/1990  Shri H.N.  Das,  Chief  Secretary,
submitted a  note to  the Chief  Minister, stating  that  he
wished to  proceed on leave immediately, for which he sought
approval. The  entire note  (at pages  42-43- of  the  paper
book) is as follows :-
""CHIEF MINISTER.
     I wish  to proceed on leave immediately.
Formal   application    will   be   submitted
separately.
     This  may   kindly   be   approved   and
alternative arrangement ordered.
sd/- H.N.Das
8/11/1990, C.S.
     Additional  Chief   Secretary  will   be
incharge of  Chief  Secretary  until  further
orders.
Sd/- P.K. Mohanta
8/11/1990
     C.S. has  not specified  the  nature  of
leave or  duration, It  would be difficult to
issue any  orders on  the basis of the above.
Please explain this to C.S. in person.
Sd/-S.K. Tewari
9/11/1990
Commissioner Personnel
     I wish to apply for Casual leave for two
days  on   9/11/1990   and   10/11/1990   and
necessary orders  may please  by issued. C.M.
has already agreed.
Sd/- H.N. Das
9/11/1990.
Thus it  was clarified by Shri H.N. Das that his request was
only for two days casual leave on 9/11/1990 and 10/11/1990.
     The Chief  Minister on  the  same  day  made  an  order
directing the  Additional Chief Secretary to be in charge of
the office  of Chief  Secretary  until  further  orders.  On
10/11/1990 the  Chief Minister  made an  order addressed  to
Shri P.C.  Mishra directing him to take over charge as Chief

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 4 
Secretary until  further orders  and to  issue notifications
promoting Shri P.C. Sharma, Shri S. Manoharan, Shri C.K. Das
and Shri  A.C. Changakati all I.A.S. Officers, to the super-
time scales,  for which  orders in  the  relevant  file  had
already been  sent to  the Personnel  Department. Government
Notification dated  11/11/1990 was  issued posting Shri P.C.
Mishra as  Chief Secretary  and he  claimed  to  have  taken
charge of  the office  of  Chief  Secretary  at  3  p.m.  on
12/11/1990. On  12/11/1990, made  a complaint  to the  Chief
Secretary Shri  H.N. Das  against Shri  P.C. Mishra.  On the
same day  Shri H.N. Das as Chief Secretary sent to Shri P.C.
Mishra the  complaint of Smt. Sablok to clarify the position
addressing Shri P.C. Mishra did not make any comment or give
clarification to  Shri H.N.  Das treating  himself to be the
Chief Secretary  on that  day. An order dated 28/11/1990 was
then  issued   by  the   State  Government   notifying   the
appointment of Shri H.N. Das as Chief Secretary.
     On 10/10/1991  the State  Government  issued  an  order
conveying its  displeasure  to  Shri  P.C.  Mishra  for  his
indecorous and  uncalled for  behaviour with the junior lady
officer. Shri P.C. Mishra made his protest against the same.
However, the  State Government  by its  order dated 8/9/1992
confirmed its  earlier order  dated 10/10/1991 conveying the
State Government’s  displeasure at  the conduct of Shri P.C.
Mishra.
     It  is   this  unseemly   incident  which  led  to  the
controversy about  the exact  status of  Shri P.C. Mishra on
12/11/1990 because  of his  claim to  have assumed charge of
the office  of Chief Secretary on that day and it culminated
in the State Government’s order conveying its displeasure at
the behaviour  of Shri  P.C. Mishra. The O.A. was then filed
in the  Tribunal by  Shri P.C.  Mishra to  quash  the  State
Government’s orders dated 10/10/1991 and 8/9/1992.
     It is  unnecessary, in  view of  the stand now taken by
the State  Government in its appeals before us to adjudicate
on the exact status of Shri P.C. Mishra on 12/11/1990 and to
pronounce on  his claim  that he  was the Chief Secretary on
12/11/1990. However,  it does  appear to us that the mode of
functioning of  the State  Government  which  led  to  rival
claims by  Shri P.C. Mishra and Shri H.N. Das of holding the
office of  Chief secretary  on 12/11/1990, leaves much to be
desired. It  does appear  that the  situation resulted  from
certain ambiguous orders made by the State Government on the
request of  Shri H.N.  Das on 8//11/1990 to proceed on leave
in spite his clarification on 9/11/1990 of going only on two
days casual leave. At any r ate some confusion having arisen
son thereafter  on 12/11/1990  on the  stand taken  by  Smt.
Sablok, Joint  Secretary, Department  of Personnel  and Shri
H.N. Das having purported to exercise the authority of Chief
Secretary on  the same  day, it  was essential for the State
Government to  have clarified  the position  immediately  to
avoid  any   escalation  of  that  conflict  which  in  turn
jeopardised proper  functioning of the State Administration.
Unfortunately, this  was not  done. Even  later the ad verse
effect of  this omission  and its contribution to escalation
of  the  controversy,  was  not  realised  when  the  matter
proceeded further.  It is even more unfortunate that some of
the  senior  most  officers  of  the  Indian  Administrative
Service at  the helm of administration in the state, did not
realise the  implications of  their actions  which  resulted
from a  clash of  egos and percolated to the lower levels of
administration.
     It is  incumbent for each occupant of every high office
to be  constantly aware  that the power invested in the high
office he  holds is meant to be exercised in public interest

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 4 
and only  for public  good, and  that it  is not meant to be
used for  any personal  benefit or  merely  to  elevate  the
personal status  of  the  current  holder  of  that  office.
Constant awareness  of the  nature of  this  power  and  the
purpose for  which it  is  meant  would  prevent  situations
leading  to  clash  of  egos  and  the  resultant  fall  out
detrimental to public interest. It appears that this lack of
perception in  all concerned coupled with the failure of the
State Government  to issue  clear orders,  precipitated  the
situation into  the unseemly controversy in the present case
which must have adversely affected the State Administration.
We do hope this incident serves as a warning for the future.
We are constrained to make these observations Since they are
necessary in  the context  and  there  is  increase  in  the
frequency of such occurrences every where.
     For the  aforesaid reasons,  we expunge all the adverse
remarks contained  in the  impugned order  of  the  Tribunal
against  Shri  H.N.  Das,  the  then  Chief  Secretary.  The
Tribunal’s order  would now  remain with  this modification.
The appeals are disposed of accordingly, in these terms."

JUDGMENT:
                      J U D G M E N T
NANAVATI, J.
     Leave granted
     These two  appeals are  filed against  the judgment and
order dated  28.4.92 passed  in Company  Appeal No.1 of 1991
and the  order dated  4.8.92 passed in Civil Review No.55 of
1992 by the High Court of Patna.
     The Maghadh  Stock  Exchange  Association  (hereinafter
referred to  as ‘MSEA’)  is registered  as a  company  under
Section 25  of the Companies Act (hereinafter referred to as
the ‘Act’).  It is  a company  limited by  guarantee and not
having a  share capital. Appellant, Narendera Kumar Agarwal,
lodged with  MSEA on  9th February,  1989 an  instrument  of
transfer/nomination  for  transferring  his  interest  as  a
member in  the Company  in favour  of Respondent  No.1, Smt.
Saroj Maloo.  On 10.8.89  she  was  informed  by  MSEA  that
transfer of  membership by  nomination in her favour was not
possible in  absence of  any provision to that effect in its
Articles of Association. Aggrieved by the refusal Smt. Saroj
Maloo filed  an appeal  under Section  111 of the Act to the
Company Law  Board (hereinafter  referred to  as the Board).
The stand  taken by  MSEA before  the Board  was that in the
Articles of  Association there  was no  provision  regarding
nomination of  membership leading to transfer of the same in
favour of  nominee, prior to June 1989 and that in case of a
company limited by guarantee without share capital like MSEA
membership cannot  be  transferred  by  nomination  until  a
clause providing  for  nomination  is  incorporated  in  its
Articles of  Association.  It  was  also  contended  that  a
request for  nomination could  not have  been  received  and
considered till  a provision in that behalf was incorporated
in the  Article 27A,  the request  to transfer  could not be
granted as  it did not fulfil the requirements prescribed by
that provision.  The action  of MSEA  was also  sought to be
supported on  the ground  that Shri  Narendera Kumar Agarwal

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 3 
had subsequently cancelled his request contained in his made
by a  letter dated 6.2.89 to transfer his interest in favour
of Smt. Saroj Maloo. The Board was of the view that if there
is no  provision for  transfer  of  other  interest  in  the
Articles of  Association of  a company  limited by guarantee
and having  no share capital then the member cannot transfer
his interest  to a  third person.  The Board  held  that  in
absence of  such a  provision and  because Smt.  Saroj Maloo
failed to  establish her  case of  proper lodgement  of  the
transfer of  other interest of the member as required by the
amended Article  27A of  the  Articles  of  Association  the
action of  MSEA was  justified. It, therefore, dismissed her
application.
     She preferred  an appeal before the High Court of Patna
against the  said order  passed by the Board. The High Court
held that  no distinction  can be  made between  transfer of
share of a limited company limited by shares and transfer of
other  interest   of  a  member  in  a  company  limited  by
guarantee. Following  the decision  of this  Court  in  V.B.
Rangaraj vs.  V.B. Gopalkrishnan and others reported in 1992
(1) SCC  160 wherein it is held that the only restriction of
the transfer of the shares of the company is as laid down in
its Articles  of Association  and a restriction which is not
specified in  the Article  is  not  binding  either  on  the
company or  on the shareholders, the High Court held that as
there was no bar of transfer by nomination of other interest
in the  Articles of Association of MSEA, refusal by MSEA was
not justified  and  legal.  It  also  held  that  subsequent
incorporation of  Article 27A in the Articles cannot justify
the action  of the  MSEA. It,  therefore, allowed the appeal
and directed  MSEA to  transfer the  interest  of  Narendera
Kumar Agrawal  in the company in favour of Smt. Saroj Maloo.
While  doing  so,  the  High  Court  observed  that  it  has
proceeded only  on the  basis that there was no such bar for
transfer when the application was made.
     It was  contended on  behalf of  the appellant that the
High Court  did not consider all the relevant aspects before
directing MSEA  to register  the transfer.  It was submitted
that though  other interest  of member in a company like the
shares is  a moveable property and transferable the transfer
can be  made in  the manner  provided by the Articles of the
Association. The  learned counsel  appearing for  MSEA  also
submitted that  if the High Court had carefully examined the
Articles of  Association of  MSEA then it would have noticed
that it  does contain  restrictions with respect to transfer
of membership.
     Section 28 provides that the Articles of Association of
a company  limited by  shares may  adopt all  or any  of the
regulations contained  in Table  A in Schedule I. It further
provides that  in the  case of  any such  company  which  is
registered after the commencement of the Act if Articles are
not registered  or if  Articles are  registered in so far as
Articles do  not exclude or modify the regulations contained
in Table  A those  regulations shall in so far as applicable
be the  regulations of the company in the same manner and to
the same extent as if they were contained in duly registered
Articles. In  respect of other companies Section 29 provides
that the Articles of Association of such company shall be in
such one  of the forms in Tables C, D and E in Schedule I as
may  be   applicable  or  in  a  form  as  near  thereto  as
circumstances  admit.   It  further  provides  that  nothing
contained in  that Section  shall be  deemed  to  prevent  a
company  from   including  any  additional  matters  in  its
Articles in  so far  as they  are not  inconsistent with the
provisions contained  in the  form in any of the Tables C, D

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 3 
and E  adopted by  the company.  In this  case,  it  is  not
disputed that  Table C will be applicable. If Tables A and C
are compared  it becomes  apparent that  there are  material
differences between  the two.  These differences  and  their
effects have not been considered by the High Court. The High
Court has  also not  considered who  can be  a member  of  a
company limited by guarantee and of the nature and type like
MSEA and  whether that  would make  any  difference  in  the
matter of  transfer of  other interest of a member in such a
company. It  was submitted  that for  becoming a member of a
company like  MSEA certain  qualifications are necessary and
that would  by necessary  implication, even  in  absence  of
Articles of  Association. But  restrictions on  transfer  of
membership by nomination.
     All  the  relevant  material  is  not  before  us  and,
therefore, we  do not think it proper to express any opinion
on the merits of the controversy raised before us. We are of
the opinion  that the  High Court  should have  examined all
these relevant aspects and ought not to have disposed of the
matter by  merely observing  that no distinction can be made
in the matter of transfer of share or other interest between
a company  limited  by  shares  and  a  company  limited  by
guarantee. We,  therefore, set  aside the judgment and order
passed by  the High Court in Company Appeal No.1 of 1991 and
in Civil  Review No.55  of 1992 and remit the matter back to
the High  Court for deciding the appeal afresh after hearing
both the  sides and considering all the relevant aspects. It
is clarified  that it  will also  be open  to the parties to
raise  their   contentions  regarding   fulfillment  of  the
requirements of  Section 108.  The appeals  are disposed  of
accordingly. There shall be no order as to costs."

JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     This Court  by order  dated August  25, 1995 found, Mr.
J.Vasudevan,  Principal   Secretary,   Housing   and   Urban
Development Department,  Government of  Karnataka guilty  of
wilful disobedience of the order of this Court and sentenced
him to  undergo simple  imprisonment for one month. Thereon,
Vasudevan filed  I.As. 4 and 5 of 1995 praying for remission
of the sentence and explaining the circumstances in which he
sought the  remission. It  was also stated that the order in
question has  since been  implemented. By  our  order  dated
September 8, 1995, the applications were rejected.
     The State of Karnataka filed this I.A. on September 11,
1995 for reviewing the order dated September 8, 1995. It has
been stated  in the  application that primarily the State is
responsible to  implement this  Court’s order  through their
Secretaries and the State has highest regards for the orders
of this  Court. After the aforesaid order was passed by this
Court against Vasudevan, the judgment of this Court has been
implemented and,  therefore,  sentence  of  imprisonment  is
requested to be remitted.
     It is  now settled  law that  an appeal  or application
like the  one at  hand can  be initiated  only by the person
found guilty.  No other person has any right to intervene on
his behalf,  as he  alone is  the  person  aggrieved.  Since
Vasudevan had  filed aforesaid  applications and  his prayer
for remission  was rejected on merits, the application filed
by the  State seeking  review of  a  review  order,  is  not
maintainable. It is submitted on behalf of the State that in
view of  the extensive power of this Court under Article 142
of the  Constitution, this Court may consider the matter and
remit  the   sentence.  We  do  not  find  any  circumstance
warranting further  review of  our review order and that too
on self-same  grounds. The  contention of  the State is that
since the  action is  taken at different levels, the officer
is not  personally liable  for the violation of the order of

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
the Court.  It is their internal management and the court or
any other  party would  not know  as  to  who  was  actually
responsible for  the disobedience.  It would  be open to the
Government  to   frame  appropriate   rules  fastening   the
responsibility and  accountability for implementation of the
order of the courts and to inform the courts in that behalf.
Till this  is done, officers like Vasudevan shall have to be
held responsible  for disobedience of courts’ order relating
to their Department.
     The application is accordingly dismissed."

     These two special leave petitions are preferred against
the common  judgment and order in e.j.c. Nos. 263 and 879 of
1991 dated  13.9.1993 passed  by the High Court of Orissa at
Cuttack.
     The petitioners  who were  unsuccessful before the High
Court are  the employees  of  Rourkela  Steel  Plant.  Being
aggrieved  by  the  promotion  policy  and  rules  of  Steel
Authority of  India Limited  (hereinafter referred to as the
’SAIL’) as  adopted in the year 1986 superseding the earlier
policy holding  the field,  they challenged  the same before
the  High  Court.  Incidentally  they  also  challenged  the
promotions made  on the  basis  of  the  impugned  promotion
policy. Be it noted, it does not appear from the judgment of
the High  Court that  there was  any challenge  of promotion
given to private opposite parties individually.
     Before the  High Court  several contentions were raised
challenging the  impugned  promotion  policy.  However,  the
learned Judges while upholding the promotion policy impugned
before them  made certain  directions in  paragraph  12  and
observations in paragraphs 15 and 19 of their judgment.
     Mr. P.P.  Rao, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the
petitioners, in  view of  the directions in paragraph 12 and
observations made  in paragraphs 15 and 19 of the High Court
judgment, fairly stated before us that he is not challenging
the legality  and validity of the impugned promotion policy.
Nevertheless he  wanted to challenge the promotions given to
respondents 4  to 17  in one Special Leave Petition and 4 to
31 in  other/second Special  Leave Petition. When we pointed
out that  no such  individual challenge  to promotion of the
above mentioned  respondents was  made before the High Court
and in  view of  the fact  that there is no challenge to the
promotion policy  before us,  there is  no  scope  for  such
contention, the  learned counsel  submitted that  before the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
High Court the promotions were also challenged. As we stated
earlier, promotions as a whole were challenged on the ground
that promotion  policy impugned  before the  High Court  was
illegal, arbitrary  and liable  to be  struck down.  If that
basis does  not now  survive in view of the directions given
by the  High  Court,  there  does  not  remain  any  serious
challenge to  individual promotions given to the respondents
mentioned above.
     We may  also point  out that  in view  of the fact that
individual promotions  were not  challenged, presumably  the
concerned respondents  did not  appear before the High Court
as well as in this Court in spite of notice. Further we find
from the  judgment of the High Court that the learned Judges
have gone  into the documents made available before them and
recorded a finding as follows :-
     ""From what has been stated above, we are
     satisfied that  the SAIL  has taken  all
     efforts humanly  possible to  see that a
     true appraisal  is made  of an executive
     before he  is promoted  from the post of
     Assistant Manager to Deputy Manager.""
     In view  of the above finding and in the absence of any
other material  to hold  otherwise, we do not think there is
any cause for interference.
     In the  result, the  Special Leave  Petitions fail  and
are, accordingly, dismissed."

M.K. MUKHERJEE, J.
     Sat Pal,  the appellant  herein, and  one Des  Raj were
placed on  trial before  the learned  Judge, Special  Court,
Ferozepur for  committing  the  murder  of  Iqbal  Chand  in
furtherance of  their common intention. The trial ended with
an order of conviction under Section 302 I.P.C. and sentence
of imprisonment  for  life  recorded  against  Sat  Pal  and
acquittal in  favour of  Des Raj.  Hence this  appeal at the
instance of Sat Pal.
     According to  the prosecution case, Iqbal was a medical
practitioner in his village Chak Burwala and, normally, used
to come  back home  by 10  P.M. As, on September 20, 1984 he
did not  return home  by then his mother Bishan Devi went in
his search and found Sat Pal and Des Raj assaulting him with
Kulhari and kirch respectively in the premises where he used
to practice.  She immediately  raised alarms  and  attracted
thereby her  another son  Gurdip, who  lived nearby  reached
there. When both of them started shouting the appellants ran
away with  their respective weapons. Iqbal, however, died in
the meantime.
     As Wasawa  Ram, father  of the  deceased, had  gone  to
village Dilia  Ram  which  was  about  20  kms,  from  their
village, Jaila  Singh, uncle  of Wasawa  Ram, was  asked  by
Bishan Devi  to fetch  him. After  Wasawa Ram arrived in the
following morning  Bishan Devi,  accompanied by him, went to
the police  station and  lodged  an  information  about  the
incident at  8.30  A.M.  On  that  information  a  case  was
registered and investigation was taken by the S.I. Baljinder
Singh. He  proceeded to the spot, held inquest upon the dead
body of  labal and  after seizing the wearing appareis, sent
it for  post-mortem examination.  He also  seized the cot on
which his  dead body  was found and some blood stained earth
and made  separate parcels  in  respect  of  them.  He  also
prepared a rough sketch plan.

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 4 
     In  course  of  the  investigation  the  appellant  was
arrested on  September 24. 1984 and the shirt he was wearing
was seized  by the  Investigating Officer  as he  found some
blood stains  on it.  He then interrogated the appellant and
pursuant to  the statement  made by  him recovered  a  blood
stained kulhari.  The other accused was also apprehended and
a  blood   stained  kirch  was  recovered  pursuant  to  his
statement. After  examining  the  witnesses  and  completing
other formalities of investigation the Investigating Officer
submitted charge-sheet  and  in  due  course  the  case  was
committed to the Special Court for trial.
     The motive that was ascribed by the prosecution for the
murderous assault  on Iqbal was that the appellant suspected
liaison between his sister and the deceased.
     The  appellant   pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charges
levelled against  him and contended that he had been falsely
implicated.
     To  prove   its  case  the  prosecution  examined  five
witnesses of  whom Bishan  Devi (P.W.3)  and Gurdip (P.W.4),
figured as  eye-witnesses. Besides, the prosecution tendered
the evidence of some police officials, which was of a formal
character, through affidavits and also exhibited the reports
of the chemical examiner and the serologist.
     Though P.W.3  and 4,  who narrated the prosecution case
as detailed  earlier, were  subjected  to  searching  cross-
examination on  behalf of  the appellant,  nothing could  be
elicited wherefrom  it could  be said that their version was
improbable or  unreliable. The  F.I.R. that  was  lodged  by
P.W.3  on   the  following  morning  also  corroborates  her
evidence.
     The  learned   counsel  appearing   on  behalf  of  the
appellant, however,  strenuously  argued  that  the  unusual
delay of about 10 hours in lodging the F.I.R. and absence of
any satisfactory explanation for such delay makes the entire
prosecution case  suspect. According  to the learned counsel
the murder was a blind one and only to falsely implicate the
accused persons  a story  was concocted  by the  members  of
P.W.3’s family  and F.I.R.  lodged on the following morning.
The learned  counsel submitted  that if  the  uncle  of  the
deceased could  cover a  distance of  20 kms,  to inform the
deceased’s father he could have certainly gone to the police
station, which  was at  a distance of 6 kms, only, that very
night, to lodge the F.I.R. if really the incident took place
in the manner alleged by the prosecution. We do not find any
substance in  this contention.  Considered in  the light  of
natural and  probable human  conduct it was only expected of
P.Ws.3 and  4 to  first report  the incident  to Wasawa Ram,
father of  the deceased  and await his arrival before taking
any other  action. No  exception can, therefore, be taken to
such reaction  of P.Ws.3  and 4 nor can it be said there was
an unexplained delay in lodging the F.I.R. raising thereby a
doubt about  the bonafides  of the  prosecution case. On the
contrary, it  appears to  us, that having regard to the fact
that the  incident took  place in the night at about 10 P.M.
the  lodging   of  the   F.I.R.  in  the  following  morning
immediately after  arrival of the father of the deceased was
a prompt one.
     The other  contention which was raised on behalf of the
appellant  was   that  though   independent  witnesses  were
available  none   was  examined  and  therefore  an  adverse
presumption under Section 114 (g) of the Evidence Act should
have been  drawn by the trial Court against the prosecution.
To buttress  the above  submission the  learned counsel drew
our  attention  to  the  cross-examination  of  Bishan  Devi
wherein she had stated that there were a number of houses in

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 4 
an around the place where the incident took place. The above
answer by  itself does  not support the above contention for
there is  no evidence  on record  to show that anyone of the
nearby houses  had witnessed  the incident.  While  on  this
point we  cannot lose  sight of  the time  when the incident
took  place  and  the  fact  that  a  reign  of  terror  was
prevailing in the State of Punjab at the material time.
     The  next   circumstance  that  corroborates  the  eye-
witnesses is  the evidence  of Dr.  Mittal (P.W.1)  who held
post-mortem examination  and found the following injuries on
the person of the deceased:
1.   Incised would  12 cms.  x 3  cms. on  the front lateral
right side  on the  elbow with  muscles underneath partially
cut, verticle and oblique in direction.
2.   Incised wound horizontal in direction 17 cms. x 12 cms.
cutting through  the neck  except flap  of the  skin on  the
right side  at the level of cervical vertebra (5th and 6th).
All the structures including the spinal cord were cut. There
were multiple  cuts producing  step ladder  pattern at  four
sides.
3.   Incised wound 12 cms. x 1 cm. muscle deep horizontal in
direction 2 cms, below injury No.2.
4.   Incised wound  5 cms.  x 1  cm.  with  bone  underneath
fractured on the chin middle part.
5.   Incised wound  12 cms. x 3 cms. horizontal in direction
with bone  underneath cut  at places on the left side of the
face at  the level  of the  middle of the pinna. The lateral
end was seen cutting the pinna.
6.   Punctured wound  0.75 cm. x 0.5 cm. on the front of the
chest 6  cms. below  middle of  left clavical  with  margins
inverted and  clean cut  parallel to  each other. The angles
were sharp  on one side but slightly lacerated on the other.
The wound  was going  backward and  injuring the  pleura and
long tissues.
7.   Punctured wound  of similar description and size 7 cms.
below the nipple injuring the left lung and the pleura.
8.   Punctured wound  of similar size and description 5 cms.
lateral to  injury No.7  piercing  the  wall  of  the  chest
injuring lung and diaphragm.
9.   Punctured wound  of similar size and description 5 cms.
below injury  No.8 piercing  the abdomenial  wall peritoneum
and injuring the soleen.
10.  Punctured would  of similar  description 0.5 cm. x 0.25
cm. on  the right  chest 2 cms. from midline at the level of
the nipple bone deep.
11.  Punctured wound  of similar  description  and  size  as
injury No.9 on the front of the abdomen midline 5 cms. below
the sternum  injuring the  peritoneum and  left lobe  of the
lever.
12.  Punctured wound  of similar size and description on the
posterior side  of left  fore-arm 4  cms. below  elbow, bone
deep.
13.  Punctured wound  of similar size and description on the
front side of left fore-arm 4 cms. below elbow, bone deep.""
According to  him the  incised wounds could have been caused
by the  kulhari (Ex.M/O/1).  which was  shown  to  him.  The
statement made  by the appellant (Ex.P/10) pursuant to which
the above kulhari was recovered from under a heap of turi in
his field  also lends  assurance to  the evidence of P.Ws. 3
and 4.  The report  of the  Serologist and Chemical Examiner
that besides the kulhari the seized earth, shirt & pyjama of
the deceased  and the  charpai contained human blood also to
some extent support the prosecution case.
     Now  that  we  have  found  that  the  prosecution  has
conclusively proved  that the  appellant had  assaulted  the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 4 
deceased with  kulhari on  his person,  the next question is
what offence  the appellant committed thereby. This question
arises  in   the  context  of  the  fact  that  it  was  the
prosecution  case  that  both  the  appellant  and  Des  Raj
committed  the   murder  in   furtherance  of  their  common
intention; and  since the latter’s acquittal is not based on
mistaken identity, the appellant will be liable for his acts
only. It,  however, appears  from the  opinion of the doctor
that injury  No.2  was  caused  by  a  kulhari  and  it  was
sufficient  in  the  ordinary  course  of  nature  to  cause
instantaneous death.  When the  nature and  location of  the
injury No.2  is read  in the context of the above opinion of
the doctor  the conclusion  is inevitable that the appellant
is liable for the offence under Section 302 IPC simpliciter.
     For the  foregoing discussion we uphold the judgment of
the trial  Court and  dismiss the appeal. The appellant, who
is on bail, will now surrender to his bail bond to serve out
the sentence."

JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     A letter from Ms. Sheela Barse addressed to the Hon’ble
Chief Justice of India with respect to the deplorable
conditions in which mentally ill and insane women were
locked up and kept in Presidency jail, Calcutta, was
registered as a writ petition and certain orders passed.
Subsequently, Ms.Sheela Barse withdrew from the matter. In
her place, the Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee was
substituted. Several orders were passed by this Court from
time to time. Commissioners were also appointed to
investigate and report on the conditions obtaining in places
where women and children were being detained. Over the
years, this Court has also been monitoring the
implementation of its orders.
     When this matter was placed before us on August 21,
1995, it was suggested by Sri S. Muralidhar, learned counsel
for the petitioner (Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee) and
also by some of the learned counsel appearing for the
respondents that it would be appropriate if the function of
monitoring the implementation of the several orders passed
by this Court is made over to respective High Courts. It was
suggested that each High Court be requested to monitor and
ensure proper and full implementation of the orders of this
Court insofar as that particular State is concerned. We
found the suggestion acceptable. Sri Muralidhar, learned
counsel for the petitioner and Sri Harish Salve, learned
counsel for the respondents have placed before us their
suggestions. The following orders are made after hearing the
learned counsel:
1.   The office shall prepare requisite number of sets of
the record of this case. The record shall be in two parts.
Part-I shall contain the letter written by Ms. Sheela Barse
(along with the enclosures thereto), the orders passed by
this Court from time to time arranged in proper sequence and
the reports of the Commissioners appointed by this Court,

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
again in their proper sequence.
2.   The office shall separate the affidavits, counter
affidavits, rejoinders and further affidavits, if any, along
with their annexures with respect to each State separately.
If there are any affidavits, reports or other documents
filed by the Union of India, the same may be included in
each of such sets. This shall be treated as Part-II of the
record. Obviously, it will be separate for each State
concerned herein.
3.   The cost of preparing both Parts-I and II shall be
borne by the Union of India. After the record is prepared as
directed above, the cost thereof shall be intimated to the
learned counsel for the Union of India in this case who
shall communicate the same to the concerned authority. The
payment shall be made into the office of this Court within
three months therefrom.
4.   The office shall communicate a copy of Part-I to each
of the High Courts. Along with Part-I, Part-II relating to
that particular State shall also be enclosed.
5.   The High Courts are requested to register the record so
received by them as a Public Interest Litigation. The
Hon’ble Chief Justice of each of the High Courts is
requested to designate a Judge of that Court to deal with
the matter. The High Court shall make all such necessary and
appropriate orders as may be warranted, from time to time,
for a proper implementation of the orders of this Court. The
High Court shall also be free to pass such other and further
orders as may be found necessary or appropriate to protect
and improve the conditions obtaining in places where women
and children - not accused or convicted of any crime - are
detained.
6.   The High Court Legal Aid Committee of each of the High
Courts shall be treated as the petitioner in the matter in
that High Court. Copies of Part-I (and Part-II, wherever
applicable) shall be communicated to the respective Legal
Aid Board in the High Court.
     The High Court Legal Aid and Advice Board will assist
the High Court in the matter of monitoring compliance with
the orders and directions made by this Court. It will be
entitled to apply for such further orders and directions
from the High Court as may be found necessary in the
matters.
7.   It is made clear that the High Courts to whom the
proceedings are being made over shall be fully free and
competent to pass such further orders and make such further
directions as they think appropriate in the light of the
facts and circumstances obtaining in that particular State
consistent with and to further the objectives underlying the
orders of this Court.
8.   So far as the State of Assam is concerned, the High
Court shall ensure that the State of Assam complies with the
several suggestions made in the report of the Commissioner,
Sri Gopal Subramaniam, and the order made by this Court on
October 3, 1994 on the basis of the said report.
     With the above directions, the matter is closed.

     Leave granted.
     On   26th December, 1990, the appellant was arrested by
the SHO,  Police Station, Nanded, in connection with FIR No.
150.90. The charge-sheet was filed against the appellant and
also other accused persons for an offence under Section 6 of
the Terrorist  and  Disruptive Activities  (Prevention) Act,
1987 read  with Sections  286, 120B  and 34  of Indian Penal
Code read with Section 9(B) of the Indian Explosives Act, on
19th December, 1991. The appellant is a priest. He is now in
jail for  more than four years and eight months continuously
except for  a short  period of  21/2 months  when he  was on
parole  on  medical  grounds.  The  minimum  sentence  under
Section 6 of the TADA Act is only five years.
     The appellant  applied for  grant of  bail some time in
June,  1994.   Before  the   appellant  had   made   several
applications for bail, which were all rejected.
     On 18th  January, 1995, the Designated Court once again
rejected the  bail application  stating, inter alia, that no
fresh ground  had come  into existence  for  granting  bail,
since  June,   1994  when  the  last  bail  application  was
rejected.
     We have  perused the  record of  the case heard counsel
for both  the parties.  We are of the view that in the facts
of this case, the appellant should be released on bail.
     The order  dated  18th  January,  1995  passed  by  the
Designated Court for Rajasthan, Ajmer, is set aside.
     The appellant  herein, Giani  Pratap Singh, is directed
to be  released on  bail on  executing a  bond for  a sum of
Rs.50,000/- (Rupees  fifty thousand  only) with two sureties
of the  like amount  to the  satisfaction of  the Designated
Court, Ajmer, Rajasthan.
     The undertrial  accused shall,  on  being  released  on
bail, present  himself  at  the  police  station  which  has
prosecuted him  at least  once in a week. He will also  make

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

himself available  for interrogation  and trial  as and when
necessary. He  shall not  leave the  area falling within the
jurisdiction  of  the  Designated  Court,  except  with  the
permission  of  the  Judge  of  the  Designated  Court.  The
Designated Court  will be  at liberty to cancel bail, if any
of the  conditions  of  bail  are  violated  or  a  case  of
cancellation of  bail is otherwise made out. It will also be
open to the respondents to move for cancellation of the bail
in case  the appellant refuses to co-operate in the trial or
interrogation.
     The appeal is disposed of accordingly."

     Delay of 232 days condoned.
     The facts lie in a short compass. During the year 1982,
while the respondent no.1 was working as a Branch Manager in
Desh Priya branch of the United Bank of India at Calcutta it
was realised  that certain officers working in that bank had
conspired with  a creditor  and the bank was defrauded for a
sum of  Rs.45,000/-. On  a complaint  laid, a crime case was
registered and  the appellant  investigated the  matter  and
submitted  the   report  to   the  competent  authority  for
sanction, who,  by its  order dated  the 14th  January, 1987
accorded  sanction   under  6(1-c)   of  the  Prevention  of
Corruption Act,  1947 (for  short,  ‘PC  Act)  to  file  the
charge-sheet  against   the  respondent   for  the  offences
punishable under Section 120B, 420, 467, 468, 471, 477A, 201
and 109  IPC and  also under  Section  5(1)  (d)  read  with
Section 5(2)  of the  PC  Act.  The  respondent  filed  writ
petition in  the High  Court to quash the sanction. The High
Court by  the impugned  order dated  the 2nd  April, 1992 in
Matter  No.498/87  quashed  the  sanction  on  two  grounds,
namely, that the respondent was not given any opportunity of
hearing before  granting sanction  and in  the  departmental
enquiry conducted  by the Bank, respondent was exonerated of
the charge.  Therefore, it was not expedient to proceed with
the prosecution  of the  respondent. Hence, the above appeal
has been filed.
     It is  contended for the appellant that the question of
giving an opportunity to the charged officer before granting
sanction does  not arise  since it  is not  a quasi-judicial
function. Grant  of sanction  is an administrative function.
What is  required is  that the  investigating officer should
place all  the necessary  material  before  the  sanctioning
authority who  should apply  its mind  to that  material and
accord  sanction.   Therefore,  the   question   of   giving

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
opportunity  of  hearing  to  the  accused  before  granting
sanction does not arise.
     We find  force in the contention. The grant of sanction
is only  an administrative  function, though it is true that
the  accused  may  be  saddled  with  the  liability  to  be
prosecuted in  a court of law. What is material at that time
is that  the necessary  facts collected during investigation
constituting the  offence  have  to  be  placed  before  the
sanctioning authority  and it  has to consider the material.
Prima  facie,   the  authority  is  required  to  reach  the
satisfaction that  the relevant  facts would  constitute the
offence and  then either  grant or refuse to grant sanction.
The grant  of sanction,  therefore, being administrative act
the need to provide an opportunity of hearing to the accused
before according  sanction does  not arise.  The High Court,
therefore, was clearly in error in holding that the order of
sanction is  vitiated by  violation  of  the  principles  of
natural justice.
     The second  ground of  departmental exoneration  by the
disciplinary  authority   is  also  not  relevant.  What  is
necessary and material is whether the facts collected during
investigation would  constitute the  offence for  which  the
sanction has been sought for.
     It is  not appropriate  at this  stage to  go into  the
merits of the culpability of the respondent though sought to
be contended for by Shri Thopas Roy, the learned counsel. In
fairness to the accused, we deem it inappropriate to go into
the merits to express any opinion.
     The appeal  is accordingly  allowed, the  order of  the
High Court  is set  aside and the trial court is directed to
proceed  with   the  trial   against   the   respondent   as
expeditiously as  possible and conduct joint trial, if trial
is not  already concluded,  along with other accused. If the
case has  been separated  and the trial of other accused has
been  concluded,   then  the  trial  court  is  directed  to
expeditiously conclude  the trial  of  the  respondent,  not
exceeding one year."

       Heard   the  counsel   on  both   sides.  The  entire
prosecution case rests on circumstantial evidence. According
to  the  prosecution,  the  appellant  was  acquainted  with
deceased Smt.  Shanti Devi.  On the intervening night of May
1/2, 1986, the appellant had gone to the hut of the deceased
when she was alone and murdered for gain.
      The  circumstances to  connect the  appellant with the
crime are  that (1)  PW  18,a  hotel  clerk,  had  seen  the
appellant at  mid-night on  May 1, 1986 in the neighbourhood
of the  scene of  offence; (2)  injury on  the finger of the
appellant; (3) extra-judicial confession said to have been a
made to  PW 13  on May 2, 1986; and (4) statement made under
s.27 of  the Evidence  Act (Ext. P-8) leading to recovery of
gold ornaments  of the  deceased from the shop of the father
of the appellant spoken to by PW 22, the mediator.
     We have  carefully seen  the evidence  of PW 13 to whom
the  appellant   is  alleged   to  have  made  extrajudicial
confession. He admitted that the appellant had for the first
time taken  him in  a scooter.  He did not know the names of
the father  and the  relation of  the appellant and had gone
with the  appellant to  the Tankbund, where the appellant is
claimed to have made extra-judicial confession. The evidence
does not  inspire confidence as, according to PW. 13, though
he had  gone near  the dead body and found some person there
he did not disclose the alleged confession to anyone at that
time. Police too was seen near the dead body, but he did not
tell them  about it,  nor  about  the  availability  of  the
appellant at  that time.  No ostensible  reason was given to
take PW.13  into confidence  to confess  the crime. judicial
confession under s.164 was not recorded.
     PW.22, the recovery witness practically admitted in the
cross-examination that  he had been taken to the appellant’s
father’s shop.  His shop was opposite to the police station.
He volunteered,  at the instance of the Sub-Inspector, to go
to  the  place  for  recovery.  From  the  tenor  of  cross-

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
examination and  the answers given by him, it would be clear
that he  did not know the place of recovery. The other panch
witness was  not examined to corroborate his evidence. It is
hard to accept the uncorroborated sole testimony of PW.22 to
believe the recoveries said to have been made.
      If  these two  pieces of  evidence are  excluded  from
evidence,  no  other  unimpeachable  evidence  is  there  to
connect the  appellant with the crime punishable under s.302
I.P.C. inasmuch  as the circumstances of the presence of the
appellant near  the scene  of occurrence,  at the mid-night,
and an  injury on  his finger  are too  weak to form a chain
strong enough  to tie  the  appellant  with  so  serious  an
offence as  murder. So,  we hold  that the  prosecution  has
failed to  establish the  case against  the appellant beyond
all reasonable doubt.
     Even  with  regard  to  offence  under  s.380,  if  the
evidence of  PW.22 is  excluded, which  has to  be done  for
reason already  alluded, it  would be  difficult to  sustain
this  conviction  and  it  is  accordingly  set  aside.  The
recovered ornaments of the deceased shall be returned to her
son.
     The appeal  is accordingly  allowed. The appellant will
be set  at liberty  and shall  be released  forthwith unless
required in any other case."

     Leave granted. Heard counsel for the parties.
     The appellant  was? elected  as  a  Councillor  of  the
Khopoli Municipal  Council in  December 1991. The contesting
respondent Shri  Sable was  also elected as a Councillor. On
account  of  a  vacancy  occurring  in  the  office  of  the
President of  Municipality, an  election was  held  to  that
office wherein  the appellant  was elected as the President.
Prior to  becoming the  President,  the  appellant  was  the
Chairman of  a Committee in-charge of awarding contracts. On
the basis  of certain complaints pertaining to the period he
was the  Chairman of the said Committee, a notice was issued
to the  appellant by  the Collector calling upon him to show
cause why  he should  not be removed from the officer of the

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 3 
Councillor under  Section 44  of the  Maharashtra  Municipal
Corporation  Act,   1965.  The   appellant   showed   cause,
whereafter the  Collector removed him from the office of the
Councillor by  his  order  dated  4.10.1994.  The  operative
portion of the order reads:
     ""Therefore,  I,  G.T.Bandri,  Collector,
     Raigad-Alibag, hereby,  am disqualifying
     Shri  Baby   Samuel,  present   Chairman
     Khopoli Municipal  Council, as member of
     the Municipal  Council,  under  Sections
     44(1)  (b)   and  44(3)  of  Maharashtra
     Municipal Council  Act, 1965,  and I  am
     declaring that his post as member of the
     Municipal Council has become vacant from
     the date 5.10.1994.""
     Against the  said order of removal/disqualification the
appellant  filed  an  appeal  before  the  Government  under
Section 44(5)  of the Act alongwith an application for stay.
Since no  orders were  passed  on  his  stay  petition,  the
appellant approached  the Bombay  High Court  by way of Writ
Petition (C)  No.4465 of  1994. The  High Court directed the
Government to  dispose of  the stay petition within one week
and the  appeal within  three months  from the  date of  its
order. The  order of  the High Court was made on October 26,
1994. Inspite  of the  orders of  the High  Court, the State
Government did not pass any orders on the stay petition.
     In view  of the  vacancy occuring  in the office of the
President of  the  Municipality  on  account  of  the  order
disqualifying  the   appellant,  the  Collector  convened  a
meeting on  November 8,  1994 to  elect the President of the
Municipality, whereas  the respondent Shri Sable was elected
as the President.
     On January  7, 1995  the Government  allowed the appeal
filed by  the appellant  and set  aside  the  order  of  the
Collector dated  4th October, 1994. The operative portion of
the Government’s Order reads:
     ""In exercise  of the powers conferred by
     Section 44(4)  in Maharashtra  Municipal
     Councils,    Nagar     Panchayats    and
     Industrial   Towns    Act   1965,    the
     Government  cancels  the  Order  bearing
     No.M.A.1/28444/M.No.    41/94,     dated
     4/10/94  passed   by  the  Collector  to
     disqualify  Shri   Baby  Samuel  as  the
     member of the Municipal Council.""
     Questioning the aforesaid order of the Government, Shri
Sable filed  Writ Petition  (c) No.  675 of  1995 contending
mainly that  before allowing  the appeal he should have been
heard and that not doing so vitiates the order. In this writ
petition he  applied  for  stay  of  implementation  of  the
Government order.  Simultaneously the appellant filed a writ
petition  being   1124  of  1995  for  a  direction  to  the
authorities to  reinstate him in the office of the President
of the  Municipality as  a consequence  of the  Government’s
order. Both  the interlocutory  applications in the two writ
petitions came  up for  hearing before  a Division  Bench on
20th March,  1995. The  Division Bench  granted stay  of the
operation of the Government’s order dated 7.1.1995 as prayed
for by  Shri Sable and rejected the application filed by the
appellant to  reinstate him  in the office of the President.
The said two orders are questioned in these appeals.
     The facts  stated above disclose that the appellant was
removed  from   the  office  of  the  Councillor  and  as  a
consequence he  lost the  office of  the  President  of  the
Municipality.  The   Collector’s  order   reads:   ""I.....am

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 3 
disqualifying Shri  Baby Samuel,  present  Chairman  Khopoli
Municipal council,  as member  of  the  Municipal  Council.""
Because the  State Government did not pass any orders on the
stay petition filed by the appellant in his appeal preferred
against  the   orders   of   removal/disqualification,   the
Collector notified  and held  an election  to  the office of
the President  whereat Shri  Sable was elected as President.
This   election    was   again    a   consequence   of   the
removal/disqualification of  the appellant by the Collector.
If so,  once the  order of  removal/disqualification is  set
aside by the Government, the appellant is entitled to be put
back in  the same  position which  he was  in before  he was
removed. In  other words  not only  should he be restored to
the Councillorship  but also to the office of the President.
Shri Sable  was elected  as the  President  in  the  vacancy
caused by  the removal/disqualification of the appellant and
once the  said  removal/disqualification  of  the  appellant
goes, the  consequential action  cannot stand;  it falls  to
ground alongwith  the order  of  removal.  Shri  Sable  must
therefore yield ground to the appellant.
     Dr. Ghatate,  learned counsel  for Shri Sable submitted
that since  the impugned orders are interlocutory in nature,
this Court  should not  interfere under  Article 136  of the
Constitution. He  suggested that  the writ  petitions may be
directed  to   be  heard   expeditiously.   To   this   Shri
Vaidyanathan, learned  counsel for  the  appellant  demurred
stating that  the term of the appellant will be coming to an
end in  the year 1996 (next year) and since there is no real
possibility of  the aforesaid  writ petitions being heard in
the near future, denial of relief in this appeal could cause
grave prejudice  to the  appellant. He  submitted  that  the
impugned  orders  in  effect  amount  to  dismissal  of  the
appellant’s writ  petition and  to allowing  of Shri Sable’s
writ petition.  We are  of the opinion that in the facts and
circumstances  of   this  case   and  keeping  in  mind  the
respective rights  of the  parties, this  is a  proper  case
where we  should interfere  under Article  136. It  is  also
admitted that  as on  today, no  fresh or  other proceedings
have been  initiated  for  removal/disqualification  of  the
appellant   for   any   alleged   irregularities.   In   the
circumstances, denying  him the  office of  President  would
amount to  punishing him  for no  fault of his. It cannot be
that he is not guilty and yet he is removed from the offices
held by  him. Shri  Sable’s  writ  petition  is  yet  to  be
decided. Accordingly the appeals are allowed and the interim
orders dated  20.3.1995 made in Writ Petition (C) No. 675 of
1995 and  writ Petition  (C) No.1124  of 1995 on 20th March,
1995, impugned herein, are set aside. The appellant shall be
restored forthwith  to  the  office  of  the  Councillor  of
Khopoli Municipality  as  well  as  to  the  office  of  the
President of the said Municipality. Shri Sable shall have no
right to  continue in  the said office with effect from this
date. There shall be no order as to costs.
     The Bombay  High Court  may  consider  the  expeditious
disposal of the aforesaid writ petitions."

JUDGMENT:

     Leave granted.
     The appellant  filed a  writ petition in the High Court
seeking for a writ of mandamus directing the Commissioner of
Police  or   the  appropriate   authority  to  transfer  his
complaint dated  April 23,  1991  for  investigation  by  an
independent police  agency other  than the local police. The
High Court dismissed the writ petition summarily on November
3, 1992. Thus this appeal by Special Leave.
     We have  heard  the  learned  counsel  on  both  sides.
Unfortunately the  appellant was done to death and the trial
with regard  to  his  murder  is  pending  decision  in  the
appropriate Sessions  Court. Therefore,  we need not go into
the merits  in that behalf . The grievance of the appellant-
Late  Sri  Kaptan  Singh  was  that  he  was  the  owner  of
properties mentioned  in the writ petition; when he was kept
in the  police custody  in connection with the crime imputed
to him,  some person  holding himself  to be  his  power  of
attorney was alienating his property and was including third
parties into possession. In spite of his repeated complaints
made to the authorities, after collusion of the local police
in those  activities, no  action in that behalf was taken by
the police  officer. It  would appear  that earlier  to  the
complaint  made   by   the   petitioner-appellant   to   the
Commissioner of  Police, the  local  police  seems  to  have
investigated and  a report in that behalf was sent which now
filed as  Annexure 1  & 2  to the counter affidavit sworn by
one Alok  Kumar, D.C.P., South Delhi. It would indicate that
the dispute  is one  of acute  disputed questions  of  fact.
Under  these   circumstances,   we   cannot   satisfactorily
adjudicate the  dispute in  this appeal. Therefore, we leave
open  the   controversy  relegating  the  appellant’s  legal
representative of  Sri  Kaptan  Singh  to  have  the  matter
adjudicated  in   an  appropriate   forum.  The  appeal  is,
therefore, dismissed but in the circumstance without costs.

JUDGMENT:
          JUDGMENT
M.K.MUKHERJEE.J.
     This appeal  is directed against the judgment and order
dated June  25, 1984  passed by  the Bombay  High  Court  in
Criminal Appeal  No. 286  of 1980  whereby it  affirmed  the
conviction and sentence recorded against the four appellants
under Section  302/34  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  by  the
Sessions Judge, Bhandara.
     According to  the prosecution case in the night between
October 15/16,  1984 Antiram met with his death at the hands
of his  sons by  his first  wife (appellant  Nos.  1  and  2
herein)  and   two  sons  of  her  brother  (the  other  two
appellants). The  motive ascribed  for the  killing was that
the deceased  and his  first wife, whom he had deserted some
10/12 years  back, were fighting for long over the ownership
of the house in which the murder took place.
     In proving the charges levelled against the appellants,
the prosecution  rested its case principally upon the ocular
version of  the incident as given out by Bhivarabai (P.W.21)
the mother  of the deceased and Suresh (PW 22), a son of the
sister of Antiram, who at the material time was 8 years old.
Though the  trial Court relied upon the evidence of both the
witnesses to  find the  appellants guilty,  the  High  Court
found it  unsafe to  rely upon  the child witness in view of
obvious  reservations  in  that  regard  and  certain  major
contradictions  in  his  evidence  vis-a-vis  his  statement
recorded  under   Section  161   of  the  code  of  Criminal
Procedure.  The   High  Court,  however,  found  PW  21  was
transparently honest  and narrated  the events in a truthful
manner. In  drawing the  above  conclusion  the  High  Court
observed:-
     ""She had  the  traumatic  experience  of
     witnessing the  macabre tragedy  of  her
     own grandsons to be jailed for life more
     so when  an average Indian elderly woman

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 3 
     prizes sons over anything else being the
     perpetuators of  the  family  tree?  The
     degree of  cogency of evidence contained
     in  the  deposition  of  Bhivarabai  has
     reached  to   such  a   high  degree  of
     probability   that   we   unhesitatingly
     conclude  that  the  learned  Additional
     Sessions Judge  was right in finding the
     accused persons  guilty of offence under
     section 302  read with section 34 of the
     Indian Penal Code and sentencing them to
     undergo imprisonment for life.""
     At first  blush we  also  felt  that  we  will  not  be
justified, while  exercising our  jurisdiction under Article
136 of  the    Constitution  of  India,  in  disturbing  the
concurrent findings  of fact  recorded by the learned Courts
below, more so for the reason canvassed by the High Court in
the above quoted passage, but having gone through the entire
materials on  record we  are firmly  of the opinion that the
evidence of  PW 21  that she  had properly seen the incident
and correctly  identified the  appellants as  the miscreants
cannot be safely relied upon. We do not for a moment suggest
that as  a grand-mother  she  would  falsely  implicate  her
grandsons  as   observed  by  the  High  Court  but  as  our
discussion to  follow will  show, her  identification of the
appellants can  justifiably be  attributed  to  her  optical
aberrations.
     In her  testimony PW  21 stated that after she, her son
Antiram and  grandson Suresh  took  food  together  she  and
Suresh went  to sleep  in one room while Antiram went to the
adjoining chabari.  According to her the door in between the
room and the chapari was closed from inside. She next stated
that around  mid-night she  was awakened  by  the  sound  of
beating and therefore, she tried to open the door in between
the chapari  and her  room only  to find  that the  door was
chained from  outside also.  However, she claimed, she could
see all  the four  accused persons  (the appellants) beating
his son  Antiram with  ubharies while  she was seated on the
cot. She  asserted that  she could  identify the  appellants
through the  gap between  the two  doors and not through the
crevices of  the planks. As regards the source of light, she
stated that the electric bulb of the street pole in front of
her house  illuminated the  chapari enabling  her to see the
incident and identify the miscreants.
     It  appears   from  the   record  that   for   properly
appreciating the  evidence of PW 21, the trial Judge visited
and inspected  the locale,  recorded  a  memorandum  of  the
relevant facts  observed at  such inspection  (Ext. 32)  and
placed the  same on record in accordance with Section 310 of
the Code  of Criminal  Procedure. In  the report  the  trial
Judge recorded, inter alia, as under:
     ""The  door  opening  in  the  room  from
     chapari closed  from  the  side  of  the
     chapari by  means of  the chain and seen
     from inside  - The room into the chapari
     by myself,  A.P.P. Shri  Raut  and  Shri
     Saxena Adv. for accd.-
     a) Nothing could be seen from the gaping
     in between the 2 doors (shutters).
     b) The central pillar of the chapari and
     the gate  (entrance) of  the chapari  is
     Visible from the crevices in between the
     planks of both the shutters.""
                         (emphasis supplied)
From the above quoted passage of the report of inspection it

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 3 
is evidently  clear that  PW 21  could  not  have  seen  the
incident, much  less identify  the miscreants in view of her
categorical statement,  as mentioned  earlier, that  she saw
through a  gap between  the two  doors and  not through  the
crevices of  the planks.  This  apart,  the  report  nowhere
indicates that  the entire  chapari was  visible through the
crevices of  the planks even if we proceed on the assumption
that she could see the incident through the crevices. On the
contrary, the  report indicates  only the pillar and gate of
the chapari were visible. Unfortunately, however, neither of
the learned  Courts below  did give  much importance to this
aspect of  the matter and proceeded on the basis that it was
a minor  mistake. We  are however  unable to share the above
view as it is evident from Ext.32 that P.W.21 could not have
properly  seen   the  incident   much  less,   identify  the
miscreants. Having  regard to  the fact  that the success of
the prosecution  rested upon  the testimony of P.W. 21 alone
we feel  that the  learned Courts  below ought  not to  have
placed implicit  reliance upon  the evidence of PW 21 solely
on the ground that as a grand-mother she was not expected to
implicate her  grandsons  falsely.  Then  again  PW  21  has
admitted  in  cross  examination  that  her  eye  sight  was
weakened and  she could  not properly see an object beyond a
distance of  about one  foot. As regard the source of light,
the trial Court has noticed that distance of the street pole
on the  road was at a distance of 55 ft from the east corner
of the  central room  of the  house. In  that context  it is
difficult to  hold that  from the  light emanating  from the
street pole  from such  a distance  it could be possible for
P.W. 21 to see the incident properly, more so when she had a
defective vision.
     On the  conclusions as  above, it must be said that the
prosecution has  not been able to prove its case against the
appellants  beyond  all  reasonable  doubts.  The  order  of
conviction and  sentence recorded  against the appellants is
therefore set  aside and  they are  acquitted of  the charge
under Section  302 read  with Section 34 of the Indian Penal
Code. As  the appellants  are on  bail, they  are discharged
from             their              bail              bonds."

M.K. MUKHERJEE. J.
     This appeal  under Section 14 of the Terrorist Affected
Areas (Special  Courts) Act,  1984 is  directed against  the
Judgment and  order dated  March 26,  1985 rendered  by  the
Additional Judge,  Special Court,  Hoshiarpur convicting the
appellant under  Section 302  of the  Indian Fenal  Code for
committing the  murder of  his grand-father  Mehar Singh  on
March 6, 1984 and sentencing him to imprisonment for life.
     The prosecution  case is  that the deceased Mehar Singh
owned 22.1/2  willss of  land in  village Swal’  and  10.1/2
killas of  land in  village Alfuke.  About four years before
his death  Mehar Singh  had divided his land in village Swal
in three  equal shares and given one share to his son Mangat
Singh, another  to his  son  Kirpal  Singh,  father  of  the
appellant, and  retained the  balance. While  Mangat  Singh,
with whom  Mehar Singh  used to live cultivated his share of
that land  and also  that  of  Mehar  Singh,  the  appellant
cultivated the  land given to his father. Being apprehensive
that Mehar  Singh might  give his  share of  land in village
Swal as  also his land in village Alfuke to Mangat Singh the
appellant was  putting pressure  upon him for a moiety share
in the  land retained  by him  in village  Swal and also the
land in  village Alfuke.  Since Mehar Singh was not yielding
to such demand the latter was very much annoyed with him.
     On March 6, 1984, at or about 8 A.M. when Mangat Singh,
his  brother-in-law   Hazara  Singh  and  Mehar  Singh  were
returning from  the tubewell  in their village the appellant
came from  the opposite  direction on a bicycle armed with a
Kirpan. He  stopped Mehar  Singh, barked  his bicycle by the
side of  the pathway  and told him that as he had decided to
transfer his  share of  land to  Mangat Singh  and  did  not
accede to  his demand  he would  not leave  him alive.  With
these words  he started  infliciting repeated  Kirpan  blows
upon Mehar  Singh as  a result  of which  he fall down dead.

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 4 
Before however  Mangat Singh  and  Hazare  Singh,  who  were
little behind  Mehar Singh,  could reach there the appellant
fled away  with the Kirpan through the fields leaving behind
his bicycle, shoes and turban. Mangat Singh immediately left
for the police station asking Hazara Singh to guard the dead
body. On  the way  he met  ABI Avtar Singh near village Mewa
Singh Wala and narrated the incident to him. ABI Avtar Singh
recorded the  statement of Mangat Singh (EX.P.F) and sent it
to  the   police  station   with  his   endorsement  thereon
(EX.P.F(17) to register a case. Accompanied by Mangat Singh,
Avtar Singh  then went  to the  spot, held  inquest upon the
dead body  of Mehar  Singh and  forwarded it for post-mortem
examination. From  the spot  he seized  some  blood  stained
earth, cair of shoes. Bicycle and guroan and then prepared a
rough sketch plan.
     In  course   of  the   investigation  he  arrested  the
appellant on  March 11,  1984 and  pursuant to his statement
recovered a  blood stained Kirpan (EX.P.1). Avtar Singh sent
all  the   blood  stained   seized  articies   for  chemical
examination and  on receipt  of report  of such  examination
submitted charge-sheet against the appellant.
     The  appellant   pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charges
levellen against  him and contended that Mehar Singh used to
live with  him as  his father was insane and his brother was
panalytic. He  further contended  that it  was he  - and not
Mangat Singh  - who was cultivating the share of Mehar Singh
and that  it was  Mangat Singh  who pressing the deceased to
give half  share out  of the  land retained  by him  out the
latter did  not agree. As regards the incident the appellant
s version  was that  as usual  Mehar Singh  had gone  to the
tubewell in  the morning  but he  was in his house. While in
the house,  he learnt through the chowkidar that Mehar Singh
had been  killed. On getting that information he went to the
spot and found a number of persons present. According to him
it was Mangat Singh who registered a false case against him.
His further  defence was that Hazara Singh was also enimical
towards him  as his  wife (daughter  of Mehar Singh) did not
get any  share out  of the  property  of  Mehar  Singh  and,
therefore, he was siding with Mangat Singh.
     That Mehar  Singh met  with a  homicidal death  on  the
fateful day  stands conclusively  proved by the overwhelming
evidence on  record. In  fact, this  part of the prosecution
case was  not challenged  by the  appellant. Apart  from the
evidence of  Mangat Singh  (P.W.4) and  Hazara Singh (P.W.5)
there is  the evidence  of Investigating  Officer ASI  Avtar
Singh (P.W.7),  who deposed  that he  found the dead body on
the wheat  field, and  that of  Dr. Jasbin Singh (P.W.3) who
held postmortem  examination on  the dead  body and found as
many as  24 injuries  on his  person. According to P.W.3 all
the injuries  were ante  mortem and were sufficient to cause
death in ordinary course.
     The next  and the  most crucial question that falls for
consideration is  whether the  prosecution has  succeeded in
conclusively proving  that the appellant was responsible for
the homicidal  death of  Mehar Singh.  To prove this part of
its  case   the  prosecution   relied,  needless   to   say,
principally upon  the evidence  of Mangat  Singh (P.W.4) and
Hazara Singh  (P.W.5). Both  these witnesses  testified that
while they  were coming  back from  the tubewell after their
morning ablutions  along with  Mehar Singh, who was a little
ahead of  them, they  saw  the  appellant  coming  from  the
opposite direction  on a  bicycle with a Kirpan in his hand.
They next  testified that the appellant accosted Mehar Singh
and said  that as  he had  not yielded to his demand he will
not allow  him to  live. With  these words,  he inflicted  a

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 4 
number of  blows with  his Kirpan upon Mehar Singh resulting
in his  instantaneous death.  P.W.4 also testified about the
genesis of the trouble, detailed earlier.
     Having regard to the fact that Mangat Singh (P.W.4) and
Hazara Singh (P.W.5) were closely related to the deceased we
have considered  and assessed  their evidence with more than
ordinary care and caution. Having done so we do not find any
reason for  disbelieving them more particularly when nothing
could be elicited in cross-examination to discredit them. On
the contrary,  we find,  that the  evidence of  Mangat Singh
(P.W.4) stands  fully corroborated  by the First information
Report which  was lodged  by him  within two  hours  of  the
incident  and   contains  the   substratum  of   the  entire
prosecution case.  The next corroboration of the evidence of
P.W.4 and  P.W.5 is  furnished by the evidence of Dr. Jasbir
Singh (P.W.3)  when he  said that  all the injuries found by
him on the person of the deceased could be caused by a sharp
edged weapon  like a  Kirpan or  any other heavy weapon with
sharp edges.  When the  Kirpan (EX.P.1)  seized  during  the
investigation was  shown to  him, the  doctor opined that it
could  cause  the  injuries  found  on  the  person  of  the
deceased.
     Another circumstance,  on which  the prosecution relied
in support  of its  case was  that the  blood stained Kirpan
(EX.P.1) was  discovered pursuant  to the  statement made by
the appellant  to the  effect that  he has  concealed it. We
have  carefully  considered  the  evidence  adduced  by  the
prosecution in  this regard, particularly that of P.W.7. and
have found  the same  convincing and  reliable. Coupled with
the above  evidence is  the report  of the  Serologist which
shows that human blood was found on the Kirpan.
     The  evidence   of  P.W.4  and  P.W.5  that  after  the
appellant fled away his turban, shoes and bicycle were found
there gets  support from  the seizure of these articles from
the spot  by P.W.7.  From the  chemical analysis  report  we
further get that human blood was found on the turban but the
origin of  the  blood  found  on  the  shoes  could  not  be
determined  as   it  was   disintegrated.  It  was  however,
contended on  behalf of  the appellant that the story of the
prosecution that the appellant left behind his turban, shoes
and bicycle  was a purely concocted one for it was absurd to
believe that the appellant would leave behind those articles
to implicate  himself. According  to the learned counsel for
the appellant,  if the  incident took  place in  the  manner
alleged  by   the  prosecution   the  appellant  would  have
certainly fled  away on  the bicycle - rather than on foot -
to ensure  a speedier escape. We are not at all impressed by
this  contention.   Considering  the  manner  in  which  the
appellant gave  repeated blows  upon the  deceased  and  the
resistence the  latter but by trying to ward off the blows -
which is  evident from  the fact  that both  his hands  were
chopped off  - the  droping  down  of  the  turban  was  not
unlikely.  As   regards  the  shoes  and  the  bicycle,  the
appellant had  left those  behind obviously  because he made
the  wheat  fields  his  escape  route:  and  the  best  and
convenient way  to make  good an escape through such a route
would be to run barefooted.
     It was  also contended  on behalf of the appellant that
the learned  court  below  should  not  have  discarded  the
evidence of  Smt. Inder Kaur (D.W.1) who fully supported the
appellant s  version and  accepted that of her brother P.W.4
as relationshipwise  they stood  on  the  same  footing.  To
appreciate this  contention we have carefully considered her
evidence as  also the  reasons which  weighed with the trial
Court in  disbelieving her. The trial Court observed that if

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 4 of 4 
the appellant  had been cultivating the lands of Mehar Singh
all along,  as testified  by her,  the appellant’s name must
have been  appearing as  the cultivator  in  the  record  of
rights and  that document would have been the best evidence.
The trial  Court further  observed  that  according  to  her
evidence the  police had  gone to the village at 6 or 7 A.M.
on the  fateful day  but  it  was  nobody’s  case  that  the
incident had  occurred by  then. The trial Court fastly held
that if  really D.W.1  felt  that  the  appellant  had  been
falsely implicated,  it was  expected of her to approach the
Investigating Officer,  who according  to her was present in
the village,  and testify  about the  same.  All  the  above
considerations, in  our view,  are germane  to discredit the
defence witness. While on this point it will be pertinent to
mention that  even if  us proceed on the assumption that the
motive ascribed  by the  prosecution for the incident in not
true and  that the  defence version as given out by D.W.1 in
this  regard  is  acceptable  still  then  we  will  not  be
justified in discarding the prosecution case altogether, for
law is  now well  settled that  where the  positive evidence
against the  accused  is  clear,  cogent  and  reliable  the
question of  motive and, for that matter, proof thereof pale
into insignificance.
     For the  foregoing discussion  we do not find any merit
in this appeal and dismiss the same. The appellant who is on
pail will  now surrender  to his  ball bond to serve out the
sentence."

JUDGMENT:
                            WITH
              CIVIL APPEL NOS. 399-400 OF 1973
                           ORDER
     These appeals  are by certificate of fitness granted by
the High  Court under  Article 133(1) of the Constitution of
India. Notification  under s.4(1)  of Land  Acquisition Act.
1894(for short, ""the Act"") was published on October 15, 1959
acquiring 10  acres and  12  gunthas  of  land  situated  in
Jamnagar for  the establishment  under development  of  T.B.
Hospital. The  appellants laid  a claim pursuant to the rate
of Rs.  1,08,898/- per acre. The Land Acquisition officer in
his award  dated July  18, 1962  under s.11 awarded a sum of
Rs.2,500/- per  acre. Dissatisfied therewith, a Reference to
the Civil  Judge senior  division was made under s.18 of the
Act. The  appellants restricted  their claim  to Rs.2.00 per
sq. ft.  The Civil  Court enhanced  the compensation  to Rs.
1.25 per  sq. ft. The High Court in the impugned judgment in
the First  Appeal Nos. 521 and 519 of 1963 dated 28.7.72 set
aside the  award and  decree  of  the  Reference  Court  and
confirmed that of the Collector. Since the value involved is
more than  20,000/- the  High Court  granted a  certificate.
Thus these appeals.
     The learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  strenuously
contended that  Ex.39 dated  August 8,  1959 to an extent of
5016 sq.  ft. land  was sold  by Jaisukhlal  Devji  who  was
examined under  Ex. 32,  for a sum worked out at the rate of
Rs. 2.25 per sq. ft. and the High Court was not justified in
rejecting that  sale  deed.  In  addition,  he  also  placed
reliance on  Ex. 38  dated December  6, 1959  of Rs. 2,700/-
which worked  out at the rate of Rs. 2.88 per sq. ft. proved
through Lawshankar Monucha Manilal examined under Ex. 28 who
is the son of the vendee. It would also establish, according
to the  counsel, that  there is  a further  increase in  the
value of  the land.  He  also  buttressed  his  argument  by
reference to Ex. 41 dated July 12, 1990 under which 1200 sq.

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
ft. was  sold by Vijaykunvarba who was examined as Ex. 176 a
neighbouring  land.   The  High  Court  therefore,  was  not
justified in  reversing the  award and  decree of  the Civil
Court . We find no force in the contention.
     It is  settled law  that the  claimants like plaintiffs
are entitled  to succeed  for higher  compensation  only  on
proof of  value prevailing  as on  the date of notification.
What is  the prevailing  market value  as  on  the  date  of
notification is  a question of fact to be proved by adducing
evidence. Burden  is always  on him to prove the same. It is
seen that  the appellant  himself purchased the land in 1957
at the  rate of  Rs.190 per  acre. The  land adjacent to the
land under acquisition in s.No. 225-I admeasuring 8 acres 39
gunthas was purchased by one Umiyashankar Damodar Vyas under
Ex. 55 on August 25, 1960 at the rate of 568 per acre. Ex.39
strongly relied  upon by the claimants was executed just two
months prior  to the  date of the Notification. It is common
knowledge that  issuance of  Notification  under  s.4(1)  to
intiate acquisition  would take  considerable time  and  the
publecation of  the NOtification  under s.4(1)  of  the  Act
would be  made much later on. Having had knowledge, it would
be obvious that documents would be brought into existence to
inflate the  market value.  Ex. 39  was sought to be pressed
into service  to inflate the market value. The conclusion of
the High  Court is  that no attempt was made by the claimant
or the  vendor or vendee who were examined, to prove Ex.p.39
to prove the distance of the land covered in Ex.p-39 and the
land under acquisition or as a comparable sale. We have seen
the award  of the  Collector. All  the sales referred in the
award would  only show  the sales on acrage basis. Obviously
the documents  have been brought into existence on the basis
of the  sq. ft. to inflate higher market value. The property
of 10  acres and  12 gunthas  , when offered for sale in the
open market,  no  prudent  purchaser  would  be  willing  to
purchase the  same on  sq. ft. basis. If the small extent of
land in  a commercial  area, like Nariman point in Bombay or
Connaught Place  in Delhi is sought to be acquired, perhaps,
determination of  the compensation  on the  basis of the sq.
ft. may be justified. But when the claimant himself assessed
the market value at Rs. 190/- per acre and purchased in 1957
and when  in 1960  the 8 acres and 39 gunthas of nighbouring
land was  sold for  Rs. 568/- per acre, no prudent purchaser
would offer  to purchase on square foot basis. This Court in
a  catena  of  decisions  deprecated  the  practice  of  the
reference courts  or High Court to determine market value of
the lands on sq.ft. basis unless it is established as a fact
that the  acquired lands  are  situated  in  already  highly
developed residential  and  industrial  area  where  regular
sales are  on sq.ft.  basis. The  High Court  also has given
cogent and  well considered  reasons in  not  accepting  the
award and  decree of  the Reference Court. We have carefully
gone through  the judgment and we find no compelling reasons
to differ  from the  cogent reasons given by the High Court.
Accordingly,  the   appeals  are   dismissed  but   in   the
circumstances without costs."

          CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION
          CIVIL APPEAL NO.5493 OF 1995

Mrs. Sujata V. Manohar, J.
     Special leave granted.
     The present  appeal is  from an  order of  the  Central
Administrative Tribunal,  Calcutta Bench,  dated 6.5.1994 by
which the appellants’ appointments to the post of Guard have
been set  aside. At  the material  time the  appellants were
holding the  substantive posts  of Trains Clerks in the pay-
scale of Rs.1200-2040(RP). They were, however, provisionally
promoted to  the posts of Assistant Head Train Clerks in the
pay-scale of  Rs.1400-2300. The  Eastern  Railway  issued  a
Circular dated  10.9.91 for filling up the 152 posts of Good
Guards which  included the backlog of previous selection, in
the pay-scale  of Rs.1200-2040,  by  departmental  promotion
from different eligible streams. One of the eligible streams
was of  Train Clerks in the pay-scale of Rs.1200-2040. Under
the  Circular  dated  10.9.91  the  last  date  for  sending

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 2 
applications was  30.9.91. Since the appellants were holding
the substantive  post of Train Clerks they applied for their
reversion to  the  substantive  post  of  Train  Clerks  and
applied for  the post  of Guard  as per  the Circular  dated
10.9.91.  The   applications  were   made  before   30th  of
September,1991. The  request of the appellants for reversion
to the  substantive post  of Train  Clerks was  accepted  on
6.12.91. Thereafter,  the appellants  functioned in the post
of Train  Clerks from  the dates  which are  set out  in the
Chart which  has been annexed at page 119 of the paper-book.
From  their   respective  dates  of  reversion  any  payment
received by them as Assistant Head Train Clerk has also been
recovered/deducted from  their salary. The Railway Board had
been moved  in  the  meanwhile  by  the  Divisional  Railway
Manager in  connection with,  inter alia, the request of the
appellants to be allowed to apply for the post of Guards and
this permission  has been  granted by  the Railway  Board by
their letter dated 13.8.92, a copy of which is annexed as R-
I to the counter-affidavit of respondents 1 to 3. As per the
letter  of  13.8.92  in  the  selection  process  which  had
started, Train  Clerks who were in the grade of Rs.1400-2300
were allowed  to appear  for selection  to the post of Goods
Guard as a last exception.
     Pursuant to  the applications  which were  received  as
aforesaid, selection  test were held in March, 1992 by which
day the appellants had reverted to the post of Train Clerks.
They were allowed to appear for the test and were ultimately
selected by  Office Order  dated 17.11.92 when the selection
list was  published. The  selected persons  were sent for 37
days’ training  and thereafter  were given  the  posting  as
Goods Guards at different places.
     Respondents 4  to 23  challenged the  selection of  the
appellants before  the Tribunal  on 15th  of December, 1992.
This challenge has been upheld by the Tribunal.
     Looking to  the fact  that  the  appellants  were  only
provisionally holding  the  post  of  Assistant  Head  Train
Clerks and  were  holding  the  substantive  post  of  Train
Clerks, the  appellants were  eligible for selection for the
post of  Guard. They were also reverted to their substantive
post and  excess pay was recovered from them in November and
December, 1991  prior to  their being  allowed to appear for
selection test.  Any doubt  on this  score is set at rest by
the letter  of 13.8.1992.  The Tribunal  was, therefore, not
right in  setting aside  the selection of the appellants and
cancelling their appointments to the post of Guard.
     The order of the Tribunal is accordingly set aside. The
appellants having been duly selected and appointed as Guards
are entitled  to hold  the post.  The appeal  is accordingly
allowed. In  the circumstances, there will be no order as to
costs."

JUDGMENT
Mrs. Sujata V. Manohar, J.
Delay Condoned.
Special leave Granted.
This appeal  is from  an order of the Central Administratice
Tribunal, Allahabad  Bench, dated  22nd of April, 1994 in O.
A. No.849/1993.
     The  respondent   was  granted  selection  grade  (non-
funcational) in the post of Deputy Commissioner of Incometex
with effect  from 1.1.86,  by an office order dated 11.3.92.
The respondent was paid an amount of Rs.20,772/- pursuant to
the granting of the selection grade to him w.e.f. 1.1.86, in
the last week of March, 1992.
     The respondent  filed the above O.A. No.849/1993 before
the Central Administratice Tribunal claiming interest on the
said amount  from 1.1.86  to the  end of  March,  1992.  The
tribunal by  the impugned  otrder has granted interest @ 12%
per annum for the saidf period to the respondent. This order
is challenged in the present appeal.
     The respondent  jouned the  Indian Revenue  Service  in
1969. He was promoted as Deputy Commissioner of Incometax in
the year  1979. The  respondent was considered fro thr grant
of  non-functional   selection  grade  by  the  Departmental
Promotion Committee  held in  May/June 1990.  His  case  was

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 2 of 3 
deferred as his Confidential Reports were not available. His
name was  again considered  by  the  Departmental  Promotion
Committee held  after 3  month in  September  1990.  As  the
integrity  of  the  respondent  was  not  certified  by  the
vigilance departmental,  and two  memoranda had already been
issued to  him calling  for his explanation, the findings of
the  Departmental   Promotion  Committee   relating  to  the
respondent were  kept in  a sealed  cover in accordance with
the provision  contained  in  the  DOP&T  OM  No.22011/2/86-
East(A) dated 12th of January 1988.
     The respondent  approached the  Central  Administratice
Tribunal at Delhi against the adoption of the procedure of a
sealed cover  in the  matter of  grant of selection grade to
him. The  Tribunal by  its order  dated 3rd of January, 1991
ordered the Department to give effect to the recommendations
of  the  Departmental  Promotion  Committee  w.e.f.  1st  of
January 1986,  this being  the date from which person junior
to the  respondent  were  granted  non-functional  selection
grade, provided  he was  declared fit  by  the  Departmental
Promotion Committee.
     On 16th  of July  1991 a charge-sheet was served on the
respondent. The  Department, however,  in view  of the above
order of  the Tribunal, took steps of implement the order by
adopting the  appropriate departmental procedure for opening
the sealed  cover. When  the sealed  cover  was  opened  the
respondent was  found fit.  The requisite  approval from the
Finance  Ministry  was  obtained  on  5th  of  March,  1992.
Thereafter,  orders   were  issued  granting  non-functional
selection grade  to the  respondent on  11th of March, 1992.
The consequent  payment 1992.  We are  further informed that
the departmental  proceedings are  still pending against the
respondent.
     In these  ciroumstances we have to examine whether ther
order of  the Tribunal  granging interest @ 12% per annum to
the respondent for the period January 1986 to March 1992 can
be upheld.  In the first place, there is no provision of law
under which  such interest  can be  granted. Learned Advocte
for the respondent, however, has contended before us that on
equitable considerations,  the Tribunal has granted interest
@ 12% per annum  to the respondent and we need not interfere
with the  discretion  exercised  by  the  Tribunal  in  this
regard. But  looking to  the facts  and circumstances of the
present case,  we  cannot  accept  the  submission  made  by
learned Advocate for the respondent. Before any interest can
be granted on equitable considerations, it is necessary that
the facts  of the  case  should  be  examined  to  ascertian
whether there  are any  special equties  which would justify
the grant of such interest although there is no provision in
law for such grant. We have failed to find any such equities
in favour  of  the  respondent  in  the  present  case.  The
respondent  alongwith   others  was   considereed   by   the
Departmental Promotion, Committee for the grant of selection
grade only  in 1990.  All those  who were  selected  by  the
Departmental Promotion    Committee  and  granted  selsction
grade w.e.f.  1.1.86 were given the difference in salary and
other emoluments  soon  after  the  issuance  of  the  order
granting  them   selection  grade.  None  of  them  received
interest from January 1986 on the amounts so paid, althought
they were  granted selsecion grade w.e.f. 1.1.86 In the case
of the  Departmental Promotion committee immediately and the
sealed cover  procedure had  to be  resorted to  because his
intergarity was  not certified  by the Department in view of
the  two   memoranda  having  already  been  issued  to  the
respondent. We  will assume in favour of the respondent that
these memoranda  as well  as the  chargesheed which has been

http://JUDIS.NIC.IN 
SUPREME COURT OF INDIA
Page 3 of 3 
subsequently  issed,   are  unwarpanted.  navertheless,  the
Departmental Promotion  Committee was  required to adopt the
sealed cover  procedure for  vailed reasons.  it was only on
account of  the order  dated 3rd  of January, 1991 issued by
the Central  Administrative Tribunal, Delhi, that the sealed
cover was opened, although investigations were pending and a
charge-sheet had  also been  issued. In  these circumstances
selection grade  was granted  to the respondent by the order
dated 11th  of March  1992.  It  is  difficult  to  see  any
equities in  favour of  the respondent  which would  require
granting on any iterset to him form 1st January, 1986 as has
been done  in the  present  case.  At  any  rate,  when  the
Departmental Enquiry  is not complete and the respondent has
not so  far been exonerated of the charges made against him,
the grant of interest appears to be wholly unjustified.
     In the  above circumstances, as we fail to see any kind
of equity in favour of the respondent, the impugned order of
the Tribunal  is set aside and the appeal is allowed. In the
circumstances, there will be no order as to costs."

JUDGMENT:
                         O R D E R
     This appeal  by special  leave arises from the award of
the Industrial  Tribunal, Lucknow  made  in  Adj.  Case  No.
7708/83 on  28.4.1984.  The  admitted  facts  are  that  the
respondent declared lock-out from 4/5th June, 1978 and wages
to the  workmen were deducted for that period. An industrial
dispute was  raised which  came to be referred under Section
4-k of the U.P. Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, the state Act
which is  equivalent to  Section 10(1) (c) of the Industrial
Disputes Act,  1947, the  Central Act.  The  Tribunal  after
considering the  entire evidence  on record and appreciating
the diverse  contentions raised  by the  counsel  on  either
side, recorded,  as a  fact, the  finding that  the lock out
declared by  the respondent  w.e.f. 4/5th June, 1978 to 18th
June, 1978  was both  just and lawful, hence the question of
any relief to the workmen does not arise.
     It is  contended by Shri A.k. Goel, learned counsel for
the appellant, that on the own showing of the respondents it
is not a case of total strike by the rival unions; there was
production to  the extent  of 15%  which would show that the
strike which ended on May 31, 1978 and the lock-out declared
on 4/5th  June, 1978  was not  due to  continuing strike and
that,  therefore,   the  management  was  not  justified  in
reaching the  conclusion  without  following  the  procedure
prescribed under  Section 6-s(2)  of the  state Act which is
equivalent to  Section 22 (3) of the Central Act, to declare
lock-out. With  a view  to appreciate  the contention, it is
necessary to extract the relevant provisions of the Act.
     Section 22  falls in Chapter V which deals with strikes
and lock-outs.  It prohibits strikes and says that no person
employed in  public utility  service shall  go on  strike in
breach of  contract as  enumerated in clauses (a) and (d) of
sub-section   (1)   thereof.   Sub-section   (2)   prohibits
declaration of  lock-out for  the circumstances mentioned in
the clauses  (a) to  (d) of sub-section (2). Sub-section (3)
postulates that ""the notice of lock-out or strike under this
section shall  not be  necessary where  there is  already in
existence a  strike or,  as the case may be, lock-out in the
public  utility   service,  but   the  employer  shall  send
intimation of such lock-out or strike on the day on which it

is declared,  to such  authority as  may be specified by the
appropriate Government  either generally or for a particular
area or for a particular class of public utility services.""
     Section 24 declares what are illegal strikes or illegal
lock-outs. It  says that ""a lock-out declared in consequence
of an  illegal strike or a strike declared in consequence of
an illegal  lock out  shall not be deemed to be illegal"". It
is seen that the strike continued until 4/5th June, 1978 and
the lock-out  was continued upto 18th June, 1978. In view of
the finding  recorded by  the Tribunal  that  there  was  an
illegal strike  in consequence  of which  the  lock-out  was
declared by the respondent-Management, it cannot be declared
that the  lock-out is illegal. On that finding, the question
arises: whether  they are  entitled to  the payment of wages
for the period of lock-out?
     The controversy as regard illegal strike and payment of
wages for  that period  was  considered  by  this  Court  in
Syndicate Bank  and Anr.  vs. K.  Umesh Nayak  [(1994) 5 SCC
572] by  a Constitution Bench. It was held that ""no-work no-
pay"" is the principle applicable to public utility services;
wages during  strike period  would be  payable only  if  the
strike is both legal and justified but not payable if strike
is legal  but not  justified or  justified but  illegal. The
strike may be of different forms like go-slow, work to rule,
refusal to  work overtime,  irritation strike  etc.  we  are
bound by  the ratio  of the said Constitution Bench judgment
which applies  to declaration  of the  lock-out which is the
consequence of  illegal strike organized by the workmen. The
lock-out is both legal and justified in the present case. As
a result,  the workmen  are not  entitled to  the payment of
wages for the period during which the lock-out continued.
     The appeal is accordingly dismissed. No costs."
